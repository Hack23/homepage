Start with our Compliance Framework, review our public ISMS repository demonstrating radical transparency, and follow our evidence-based compliance approach. Key success factors: executive buy-in, realistic scope definition, and treating compliance as a continuous process rather than annual audit theater."

It matters because every security decision, control, and investment should balance these three principles based on business impact. Over-focusing on confidentiality while neglecting availability leads to unusable systems. Prioritizing availability without integrity results in untrustworthy data. Our comprehensive CIA Triad FAQ provides detailed implementation guidance, real-world examples, and business impact analysis.

Process: identify assets and data flows, decompose architecture using diagrams (data flow, C4 model), apply STRIDE to each component systematically, assess likelihood and impact for each threat, prioritize based on risk rating, implement mitigations and controls, document assumptions and exclusions, and review regularly as architecture evolves. Our Threat Modeling Policy provides methodology details, and real examples from CIA Security Analysis and Compliance Manager STRIDE analysis demonstrate practical application across different architecture types."

DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tests running applications by simulating attacks to discover runtime vulnerabilities, authentication issues, and configuration problems—finds issues SAST misses but requires deployed application and provides less precise location information. SCA (Software Composition Analysis) examines third-party dependencies, libraries, and open-source components for known vulnerabilities (CVEs), license compliance issues, and outdated packages—critical for supply chain security. Effective security requires all three: SAST catches code issues during development, SCA identifies vulnerable dependencies before deployment, and DAST validates security in production-like environments. Our Vulnerability Management Policy details comprehensive testing strategy."

Critical success factors: assume a breach mentality, practice incident response regularly, maintain audit logs, have tested backup/recovery procedures, and establish a coordinated disclosure process. Review our Incident Response Plan for detailed procedures and playbooks."

Organizations must perform risk assessment to determine which controls apply to their context—not all 93 are mandatory, but decisions must be justified in Statement of Applicability (SoA). Implementation should be evidence-based, not checkbox compliance theater. Our Compliance Frameworks guide maps Annex A to NIST CSF 2.0 and CIS Controls for comprehensive coverage, and our public ISMS repository demonstrates transparent implementation."

            "text": "ISMS maintenance requires continuous improvement, not annual compliance theater: conduct quarterly strategic reviews assessing emerging threats, technology changes, and business context evolution; perform regular internal audits using a risk-based approach rather than checkbox exercises; monitor and measure security metrics continuously (not just before surveillance audits); update risk assessments when significant changes occur (new systems, threats, regulations); maintain living documentation that evolves with actual practices; provide ongoing security awareness training adapted to current threat landscape; review and test incident response procedures regularly; track and remediate non-conformances systematically; engage stakeholders continuously rather than only during audit season; and embrace transparency to enable external feedback and improvement. The goal: security becomes business-as-usual, not compliance event. Our ISMS Strategic Review approach and public ISMS benefits analysis demonstrate continuous improvement over certification theater."

    <section id="introduction">
      <p><strong>Bienvenido al Blog de Seguridad de Hack23</strong> — donde exponemos las cómodas mentiras del complejo industrial de seguridad a través de la transparencia radical. <em>¡Piensa por ti mismo! Cuestiona la autoridad.</em> Especialmente las autoridades de seguridad que se benefician de tu miedo mientras instalan las mismas puertas traseras de las que afirman protegerte.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Nada es verdad. Todo está permitido.</strong> Incluyendo el examen honesto del teatro de seguridad, los estados de vigilancia y las puertas traseras en tu "cifrado de grado militar" (aprobado por las mismas agencias que ejecutan PRISM).</p>
      <p>Explora <strong>65 publicaciones de blog</strong> que eliminan las tonterías del marketing para revelar lo que realmente importa—desde <strong>Convergencia Automatizada a través de Agentes de IA</strong> hasta la implementación de la Tríada CIA, OWASP LLM Top 10 hasta la Ley de Ciberresiliencia de la UE, capacidades de vigilancia de estados-nación hasta operaciones de inteligencia OSINT política que exponen la rendición de cuentas democrática a través del análisis de comportamiento.</p>
      <p>Además, las <strong>13 Crónicas de Arquitectura de Simon Moon</strong> y las <strong>Operaciones de Inteligencia y Desarrollo de Negocios de Hagbard Celine</strong> que revelan geometría sagrada en el código, arquitecturas de cinco patrones, la Ley de los Cinco, verdad numerológica en el diseño de sistemas e Inteligencia como Servicio para la cobertura mediática de las elecciones suecas de 2026. Todo a través de la lente discordiana que cuestiona <em>todo</em>—especialmente las cosas que "todos saben" que son verdad. <strong>FNORD.</strong></p>
      
      <p><em>¿Ya eres lo suficientemente paranoico?</em> Bien. Estás empezando a prestar atención. La mayoría de las empresas ocultan sus políticas de seguridad porque la transparencia expondría lo mala que es su seguridad en realidad—rituales de cumplimiento de culto cargo y teatro costoso que pretende ser protección. Publicamos las nuestras en GitHub. Las 54 publicaciones y políticas. Cada marco. Cada evaluación de riesgos. Cada patrón arquitectónico. Cada metodología de operación de inteligencia. <strong>La seguridad a través de la transparencia</strong> supera la seguridad a través de la esperanza, la oración y cruzar los dedos para que nadie note que estás funcionando con cinta adhesiva y promesas de proveedores.</p>

      <p><em>"El código es realidad hecha computacional. Si no funciona, nada más importa."</em> — George Dorn</p>
      
      <p><strong>El Héroe Reluctante Habla:</strong> Mientras Simon Moon arquitecta patrones cósmicos y Hagbard exige transparencia revolucionaria, alguien tiene que hacer que el código realmente funcione. Ese alguien es <strong>George Dorn</strong>—desarrollador, ingeniero impulsado por el pánico, escondedor de huevos de pascua y héroe reluctante que lucha con diseños elegantes hasta convertirlos en realidad desordenada.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Verificación de Realidad del Desarrollador:</strong> Los comentarios técnicos de George revelan cómo se ve realmente construir productos Hack23—los momentos de pánico, los avances, el vigésimo tercer intento de depuración que finalmente tiene éxito, y las sincronicidades ocultas en recuentos de commits, tiempos de compilación y lógica de reintentos. <em>Piensa por ti mismo sobre lo que realmente significan las "mejores prácticas" al implementar las arquitecturas de cinco capas de Simon en producción.</em></p>

          <p><strong>El Stack:</strong> Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, PostgreSQL, 60,000+ líneas en 23 módulos Maven. <strong>2,347 commits</strong> en 5 años. <strong>91 tablas</strong> luchando contra cambios de formato de API del riksdag. <strong>OpenSSF Scorecard 7.2/10.</strong> El comentario de George en el blog de Arquitectura CIA revela los momentos de pánico: API del riksdag rompiendo pruebas de integración, base de datos de producción llegando a 50GB, vulnerabilidades de dependencias requiriendo arreglos toda la noche.</p>
          <p><strong>Huevos de Pascua:</strong> Hash de contraseña Argon2 con 23 iteraciones. Tiempo de espera de sesión: 23 minutos. Migración de base de datos 023 agregó cinco vistas analíticas principales. Mensajes de error conteniendo referencias FNORD. <em>Seguridad con ingenio subversivo.</em></p>

Stack web puro simulando 70 puntos vitales a 60fps. <strong>23,000+ líneas</strong> en 150+ módulos. <strong>1,247 commits</strong> en 2 años.

      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Sabiduría del Desarrollador:</strong> Los comentarios de George enseñan lo que la documentación rara vez revela—la brecha entre arquitectura elegante y código funcionando. Las cinco etapas del desarrollo (Negación → Pánico → Investigación → Percepción → Completitud). Las sincronicidades apareciendo en números de versión y recuentos de commits. Los huevos de pascua ocultos para los observantes. <strong>Código que funciona Y deleita = expansión de conciencia a través de ingeniería de software.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Lecciones Clave de George:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Las pruebas salvan del pánico.</strong> 570+ pruebas = red de seguridad al refactorizar. Las pruebas son documentación que se ejecuta.</li>
        <li><strong>Las cinco capas de Simon funcionan.</strong> Inicialmente escéptico. La separación de preocupaciones habilita evolución independiente. Patrones cósmicos = accidentalmente buena ingeniería.</li>
        <li><strong>Los datos políticos/culturales son caos encarnado.</strong> Los modelos de dominio deben abrazar el caos—validez temporal en todas partes, historial de auditoría en todo, verificaciones null de nivel paranoia.</li>
        <li><strong>Los huevos de pascua importan.</strong> El código puede ser funcional Y delicioso. 23s y 5s ocultos por todas partes. Futuros desarrolladores descubriendo estos = expansión de conciencia a través de arqueología de código.</li>
        <li><strong>La documentación es carta de amor al yo-futuro.</strong> Seis meses después, el tú-futuro confundido necesita explicaciones. Escribe para ti mismo, no para las partes interesadas.</li>
        <li><strong>El pánico es el comienzo de cada solución.</strong> Todos los problemas de producción arreglados después del vigésimo tercer intento de depuración (o así se siente). La persistencia vence a la perfección.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-DESARROLLO:</strong> <em>Simon arquitecta patrones. Hagbard exige revolución. George hace que compile, despliegue y sobreviva al caos de producción—mientras oculta FNORD en mensajes de error. La troika de visión, filosofía e implementación. Cuestiona la autoridad. Prueba todo. Confía en la verificación. Oculta huevos de pascua. ¡Salve Eris!</em></p>

          <p>Brussels regulates your toaster. The bureaucracy expands to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy. <em>Question authority. Especially regulatory authority.</em></p>

          <p>Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 is mandatory cybersecurity for the EU market. €15M penalties, SBOM required, 24-hour vulnerability disclosure, CE marking for software. Five CRA pillars (Secure Design, Vulnerability Management, SBOM Transparency, Security Updates, Monitoring)—<strong>all legally mandated.</strong> Compliance theater vs real conformity. <em>Are your products ready? Think for yourself, schmuck!</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">About This Blog</h2>
      
      <p><strong>All 44 Discordian blog posts maintain radical Illuminatus! trilogy style:</strong> "Think for yourself, question authority," FNORD detection in every approved standard, Chapel Perilous navigation through uncomfortable security truths, Operation Mindfuck against security theater and compliance cargo cults, and 23 FNORD 5 signatures throughout. <em>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</em> Including the uncomfortable truth that your "secure" systems were probably designed by the people who want to monitor them—and certified by the people already monitoring them. <strong>The backdoor isn't a bug. It's a feature they call "lawful access."</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Are you paranoid enough?</strong> We are—systematically, methodically, with evidence and documentation. Complete coverage of <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">ISMS-PUBLIC</a> policies with hidden wisdom throughout. Each post links directly to the corresponding policy documentation in our public ISMS repository, demonstrating <strong>radical transparency</strong> in security operations. Because if your security can't survive public scrutiny, you don't have security—you have wishful thinking wrapped in NDAs and vendor promises that evaporate when the breach hits.</p>
      
      <p><em>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia! 🍎</em></p>
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>If this sounds paranoid, you're not paying attention to Snowden, PRISM, Crypto AG, or the last 50 years of documented surveillance programs. If this sounds reasonable, you're already too deep in Chapel Perilous. The only winning move is transparency—because they can't co-opt what's already public. They can't backdoor what has no doors. Think for yourself. Question everything—especially this.</em></p>
