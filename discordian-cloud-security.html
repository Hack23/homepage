            <h1>Cloud Security: Someone Else's Computer</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. The cloud is just someone else's computer."</em></p>

            <h2>☁️ The Problem: Shared Responsibility Confusion</h2>
            
            <p>The cloud is just someone else's computer. AWS secures the infrastructure. <strong>You secure everything else.</strong> This is called "shared responsibility" and most people get it wrong.</p>
            
            <p>AWS protects the hypervisor. You protect your S3 bucket permissions. They secure physical data centers. You secure your IAM policies. They patch infrastructure. You patch your applications.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> The cloud is just someone else's computer. Act accordingly. They secure infrastructure. You secure configuration. Misconfiguration is your breach, not theirs.
            </div>

            <h2>🛡️ The Five Cloud Security Pillars</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Identity & Access Management</h3>
                    <p><strong>Who can do what?</strong></p>
                    <p>Least privilege IAM policies. MFA for all humans. Service accounts with specific permissions. No root account usage.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Network Security</h3>
                    <p><strong>Control traffic flow.</strong></p>
                    <p>Security groups, NACLs, VPCs. Default deny. Segment environments. No public S3 buckets (unless intentional).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. Data Protection</h3>
                    <p><strong>Encrypt everything.</strong></p>
                    <p>Encryption at rest, encryption in transit. KMS for key management. Backup with encryption. Delete with verification.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Logging & Monitoring</h3>
                    <p><strong>See what's happening.</strong></p>
                    <p>CloudTrail for API calls. CloudWatch for metrics. Config for compliance. GuardDuty for threats.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Compliance & Governance</h3>
                    <p><strong>Policy as code.</strong></p>
                    <p>Infrastructure as code. Automated compliance checks. Tag everything. Audit regularly.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> Public S3 buckets are the new unpatched servers—obvious, inexcusable, and still everywhere. Configuration errors cause more breaches than infrastructure failures.
            </div>

            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            
            <p>Our cloud security practices are public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Cloud_Security_Policy.md" target="_blank">Cloud Security Policy</a></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong> - CloudFormation, auditable, versioned</li>
                <li><strong>Least privilege IAM</strong> - Specific permissions, no wildcards</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption everywhere</strong> - At rest, in transit, with KMS</li>
                <li><strong>Logging centralized</strong> - CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty enabled</li>
                <li><strong>Automated compliance</strong> - Config rules, Security Hub checks</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Cloud security is configuration management. The infrastructure is secure—your settings aren't. Automate configuration or accept drift. Drift is vulnerability.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Secure Your Config</h2>
            
            <p>Cloud providers secure infrastructure. <strong>You secure configuration.</strong> Shared responsibility means you're responsible for most breaches.</p>
            
            <p>Encrypt data. Control access. Log everything. Automate compliance. Or find out that your public S3 bucket leaked customer data and "but it's in the cloud" isn't a defense.</p>
