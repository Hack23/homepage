    <h2 class="header">📋 Information Security Policy: The Foundation of Radical Transparency</h2>

    <section id="intro">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Why Your Security Policy Is Secret (And Why That's Suspicious)</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself, schmuck!</strong> Most organizations treat their security policy like it's the nuclear launch codes. Marked "CONFIDENTIAL." Locked in SharePoint dungeons. Only accessible to those with "need to know" (which conveniently excludes the people who actually need to implement it). As if <em>obscurity</em> somehow enhances security. Spoiler: it doesn't. It just hides incompetence behind classification markings and prevents embarrassing questions at board meetings. <strong>FNORD.</strong> See it yet? Every "confidential" marking is a confession that transparency would reveal inadequacy.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Question authority—especially security authority:</strong> If your security policy can't withstand public scrutiny, you don't have a security policy—you have <em>security theater</em> wrapped in NDAs and marked "INTERNAL USE ONLY" to prevent anyone from noticing it's bullshit. The same people who mark policies confidential are the ones who lose them in breaches. At least we know ours can't leak—it's already public. <em>Can't compromise what's already exposed. That's not naivety—that's operational security through radical transparency.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including—especially—the permission we give ourselves to publish <em>everything</em> about how we secure systems. Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md">Information Security Policy is on GitHub</a>—it is public, forkable, and auditable by anyone paranoid enough to actually read it (are you paranoid enough?). <strong>40+ integrated policies</strong> demonstrate ISO 27001 + NIST CSF + CIS Controls alignment. Not because we're compliant (compliance is a checkbox theater production, not security), but because these frameworks actually work when you implement them systematically instead of just claiming you do in marketing materials and audit reports. <em>Evidence beats claims. Always.</em></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ILLUMINATION: Security through obscurity assumes attackers can't read or won't bother looking. They can. They read better than you do. They've probably read your "confidential" policies already—breaches happen, SharePoint leaks, disgruntled employees exist. Security through transparency assumes everyone's watching—community review, client verification, continuous improvement through public feedback. Welcome to Chapel Perilous, where publishing your entire security policy is less risky than hiding it and hoping nobody notices when it fails. Are you paranoid enough to compete on verifiable security excellence instead of marketing promises and vendor-approved "best practices"?</em></p>
      
      <p>This isn't aspirational documentation gathering dust until the next audit. It's the operational foundation of how Hack23 actually works—demonstrating cybersecurity consulting expertise through systematic implementation with public evidence. Because in the reality tunnel we inhabit, claims without evidence are just marketing. Full technical details in our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">public ISMS repository</a>. Fork it. Critique it. Improve it. We're paranoid enough to want peer review. <strong>FNORD.</strong></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Pillars of CIA+ Framework: Security As Business Enabler</h2>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. 🔒 Confidentiality (Protect What Matters)</h3>
          <p><strong>Not everything is secret. Not nothing is secret.</strong> Customer data? Secret. Marketing plans? Internal. Open source code? Public. <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md">Classification Framework</a> based on actual business impact, not paranoia. Four levels: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted.</p>
          <p><strong>Controls:</strong> Hardware MFA (YubiKey), AWS KMS encryption, role-based access control, data classification tags, DLP monitoring.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Over-classification is security negligence disguised as diligence. If everything is confidential, nothing is.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. ✅ Integrity (Trust Your Data)</h3>
          <p><strong>Data that lies to you is worse than no data.</strong> Version control (Git), audit logs (CloudTrail), hash verification (SHA-256), digital signatures (GPG), immutable infrastructure (IaC). <strong>Prove</strong> data hasn't been tampered with—don't just hope.</p>
          <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Git commit signing, CloudFormation drift detection, SonarCloud quality gates, SLSA Level 3 build attestations.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Garbage in, garbage out—unless you also verify the pipeline. Then you at least know it's garbage.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. 🟢 Availability (Systems Actually Work)</h3>
          <p><strong>Uptime isn't aspirational—it's measured.</strong> Multi-AZ deployment, auto-scaling, health checks, chaos engineering (monthly FIS experiments), <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Disaster_Recovery_Plan.md">RTO/RPO targets</a> (5-60 min critical, 1-4 hr high, 4-24 hr standard). Availability through resilience, not luck.</p>
          <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> AWS Resilience Hub deployment gating, Fault Injection Service validation, immutable cross-region backups.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>High availability without chaos testing is hope-based computing. We inject failures monthly to prove recovery works.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. 💰 Business Value (Security Enables, Not Prevents)</h3>
          <p><strong>Security proportional to business impact.</strong> Not everything needs maximum security—that's expensive and slow. <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md">Classification Framework</a> maps security controls to €10K+/day loss, €5-10K/day, €1-5K/day, &lt;€1K/day impact tiers.</p>
          <p><strong>ROI Focus:</strong> Cost avoidance (breach prevention), revenue protection (uptime), competitive advantage (speed + security), operational efficiency (automation).</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Security without business context is just expensive compliance theater. Protect what actually matters.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. 🔄 Continuous Improvement (Static = Dead)</h3>
          <p><strong>ISMS isn't "done"—it evolves.</strong> Quarterly risk reviews, annual policy updates, continuous metrics tracking (<a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Security_Metrics.md">Security Metrics</a>), automated security testing (SAST, DAST, SCA), threat modeling updates with new features.</p>
          <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> OpenSSF Scorecard ≥7.0, SonarCloud quality gates, 80%+ test coverage, &lt;4hr critical vulnerability patching.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Security frameworks that don't evolve ossify into compliance checkboxes disconnected from actual threats.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: Security Policy As Competitive Advantage</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including making your entire security policy public. Most organizations fear transparency. We weaponize it.</p>
      
      <p>Most organizations hide their security policies behind "CONFIDENTIAL" markings. They treat security documentation as trade secrets. They claim publishing policies would "help attackers." None of this is true. Security through obscurity is incompetence with a nicer name.</p>
      
      <p>We publish everything. <strong>40+ integrated ISMS policies on GitHub.</strong> ISO 27001 + NIST CSF + CIS Controls alignment with public evidence. Classification Framework driving business-focused security. CIA+ Framework enabling security as business enabler, not blocker. This isn't reckless—it's confidence. We can publish because our security actually works.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Question why security policies must be secret. Question security claims without verification. Question "trust us" when "verify yourself" is possible. (Spoiler: Transparency enables trust through verification.)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Our competitive advantage:</strong> We demonstrate cybersecurity consulting expertise through public, verifiable implementation. 40+ policies demonstrating comprehensive ISMS. Multi-framework alignment with evidence. Classification Framework enabling risk-proportional security. Public transparency proving confidence over fear. This isn't security theater—it's operational security excellence with auditable proof.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION: You are now in Chapel Perilous. You can continue hiding security policies in SharePoint and claiming "security through obscurity."
