    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Why Your Security Policy Is Secret (And Why Ours Isn't)</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Most organizations treat their security policy like a state secret. Marked "CONFIDENTIAL." Locked in SharePoint. Only accessible to those with "need to know."</p>
      
      <p><strong>Question authority:</strong> If your security policy can't withstand public scrutiny, you don't have a security policy—you have <em>security theater</em>.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including the permission we give ourselves to publish <em>everything</em> about how we secure systems. Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md">Information Security Policy is on GitHub</a>. Public. Forkable. Auditable.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Security through obscurity assumes attackers can't read. They can. Security through transparency assumes everyone's watching. They should be.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="policy-foundation">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Pillars of Non-Bullshit Security</h2>
      
      <p>Our Information Security Policy isn't a compliance checkbox. It's the <strong>operational foundation</strong> of how we actually work. The Law of Fives manifests:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. Confidentiality (Protect What Matters)</h3>
          <p>Not everything is secret. Not nothing is secret. <strong>Think.</strong> Customer data? Secret. Marketing plans? Internal. Open source code? Public. Classification based on <em>actual impact</em>, not paranoia.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: If everything is confidential, nothing is. Over-classification is security negligence disguised as diligence.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Integrity (Trust Your Data)</h3>
          <p>Data that lies to you is worse than no data. Version control. Audit logs. Hash verification. Digital signatures. <strong>Prove</strong> your data hasn't been tampered with—don't just hope.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Garbage in, garbage out—unless you also verify the pipe. Then you at least know it's garbage.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Availability (Uptime Isn't Optional)</h3>
          <p>Security that prevents access isn't security—it's a <strong>denial of service you're doing to yourself</strong>. Backups. Redundancy. Disaster recovery. Security enables business or it's just expensive failure.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Perfect security with zero availability is indistinguishable from a successful attack.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Accountability (Know Who Did What)</h3>
          <p>Audit everything. Log everything. <strong>Trust no one</strong> (including yourself). When something breaks—and it will—you need to know who, what, when, where, why. No shared accounts. No anonymous access to sensitive data.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Accountability without logs is theater. Logs without review are data hoarding. Both are useless.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. Non-Repudiation (Prove It Happened)</h3>
          <p>Digital signatures. Time stamps. Cryptographic proof. When someone claims "I didn't do that" or "that never happened," you need <strong>evidence</strong>, not arguments.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: In a world of deepfakes and gaslighting, cryptographic proof is the only truth left.</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> The goddess of chaos teaches: security isn't about preventing all attacks—it's about <em>knowing when you're under attack</em> and responding appropriately.</p>

    <section id="why-public">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Operation Mindfuck: Why Public Policy Is Better Policy</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true.</strong> Every security consultant will tell you: "Keep your security policy confidential." They're wrong. Or lying. Or both.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Everything is permitted.</strong> Including questioning security dogma that serves vendors, not users.</p>
      
      <p>Our security policy is public because:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparency improves security</strong> — When the entire internet can audit your policy, weaknesses get found. Fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability matters</strong> — Public policy means we can't claim we "take security seriously" while doing theater.</li>
        <li><strong>Customers can verify</strong> — Don't trust our marketing. Read our actual policy. Think for yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>Security through obscurity is incompetence</strong> — If your policy only works because attackers can't read it, you're already compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Radical transparency is resistance</strong> — Against security theater. Against compliance checkbox culture. Against "trust us" authority.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The security-industrial complex hates public policies because they can't sell you consulting to "fix" what everyone can see. Transparency is Operation Mindfuck against vendor FUD.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-policy-covers">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">What Our Policy Actually Says (Unlike Yours)</h2>
      
      <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md">read the full policy yourself</a>, but here's the non-bullshit summary:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🎯 Scope & Applicability</h3>
          <p>Applies to everyone. No exceptions. CEO follows same rules as interns. Because <strong>privilege without accountability is corruption</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>👥 Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>Who owns security? Everyone. Who's accountable? Named individuals. No "security is everyone's responsibility" cop-out without actual names.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🔒 Access Control</h3>
          <p>Least privilege. Need-to-know. Time-limited access. <strong>Trust, but verify.</strong> Actually, just verify.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>📊 Risk Management</h3>
          <p>Identify risks. Assess impact. Treat appropriately. <strong>Document everything.</strong> No risk theater—actual analysis with actual decisions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🚨 Incident Response</h3>
          <p>Assume breach. Plan detection. Practice response. <strong>When</strong> (not if) you're compromised, execute the plan you've actually tested.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>📚 Training & Awareness</h3>
          <p>Security training that isn't death-by-PowerPoint. Practical. Testable. <strong>Measured.</strong> Because compliance certificates without understanding are worthless.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Foundation of Guerrilla Security</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself. Question authority.</strong> Especially security authority that insists you must keep policies secret.</p>
      
      <p>Our Information Security Policy is public because:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Security through obscurity is a lie</strong> told by people selling expensive "secrets"</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency enables accountability</strong> which improves actual security</li>
        <li><strong>Public policy forces us to practice what we preach</strong> or get called out</li>
        <li><strong>Customers deserve to verify</strong> not just trust vendor claims</li>
        <li><strong>Radical transparency is resistance</strong> against security theater industrial complex</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including actually reading our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md">full Information Security Policy on GitHub</a>.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>FINAL ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The question isn't "Should our security policy be public?" The question is "Why are you hiding yours?" Answer honestly. Then question the answer.</em></p>
