    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Integrity-Availability Connection</h2>
      
      <p>We've all experienced it: You're trying to solve a problem when someone casually mentions, "Oh, we already fixed that last year." Where's the documentation? "It's in my email somewhere." Or worse: "We discussed it in a meeting with the previous team lead."</p>
      
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The CIA Triad's forgotten relationship: How availability directly impacts data integrity</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>This isn't just annoying—it's a fundamental breakdown of the Availability principle in the CIA triad that directly creates Integrity failures. When information that should be available to authorized users is instead trapped in personal storage, email threads, and undocumented meetings, the organization loses its ability to maintain data integrity across time and teams.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="information-hiding">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">How Information Gets Hidden From Those Who Need It</h2>
      
      <p>Five common patterns of information hiding that are crippling organizations. Each one creates a specific type of integrity failure:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phantom Meetings:</strong> Critical decisions made in meetings that have no agenda, minutes, or central record. Only those who attended know what was decided.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Threads as Knowledge Bases:</strong> When key information lives only in email exchanges between a select few people, creating artificially restricted information.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Storage Silos:</strong> Information kept in personal OneDrive accounts or local drives that become completely inaccessible when someone leaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-restricted SharePoint Sites:</strong> Collaboration spaces with permissions set so narrowly that relevant stakeholders can't access information they need.</li>
        <li><strong>Shadow Documentation:</strong> Documentation maintained in unofficial, limited-access locations rather than in designated repositories.</li>
      </ul>
      
    </section>

    <section id="understanding-impact">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">When New Work Is Built On Incomplete Knowledge</h2>
      
      <p>Information hiding doesn't just waste time—it actively corrupts the integrity of new work. When people make decisions without access to critical context and previous work, they:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Create <strong>conflicting implementations</strong> that don't align with existing systems</li>
        <li>Make <strong>redundant solutions</strong> that waste resources and create maintenance issues</li>
        <li>Implement <strong>contradictory policies</strong> that create compliance risks</li>
        <li>Establish <strong>incompatible processes</strong> that can't integrate with existing workflows</li>
        <li>Generate <strong>inconsistent data</strong> that undermines reporting and analysis</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In each case, the integrity of organizational knowledge and systems is directly compromised because of an availability failure. People aren't working with bad information—they're working with incomplete information.</p>

          <h3>The Invisible Architecture Decision</h3>
          <p>An architectural decision to standardize on specific cloud services was made in a leadership call with no documentation. Six months later, a new team implemented a solution using incompatible technologies, creating a fragmented architecture that required costly remediation. No one had told them about the standard—it only existed in the memories of those on the original call.</p>
          <p><strong>Integrity Impact:</strong> Fragmented systems with incompatible architectures that couldn't be integrated without significant rework</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>The Email Thread Knowledge Base</h3>
          <p>Critical customer requirements were discussed and refined solely through email exchanges between a product manager and three key stakeholders. When the product manager left the company, the development team built features based on incomplete documentation. The resulting product failed to meet actual customer needs because key details were locked in an email archive no one could access.</p>
          <p><strong>Integrity Impact:</strong> Product features built on partial requirements that didn't meet actual customer needs</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>The Personal OneDrive Documentation</h3>
          <p>A security engineer documented detailed configuration requirements in Word documents kept on his personal OneDrive. He shared links with specific people when asked but maintained control of the master documents. When he changed roles, his replacement inherited systems with no documentation. Security configurations gradually drifted from requirements because no one knew what they should be.</p>
          <p><strong>Integrity Impact:</strong> Security configurations that slowly degraded due to lack of available documentation</p>

    <section id="solutions">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Breaking the Information Hoarding Cycle</h2>
      
      <p>To stop this integrity-destroying information hoarding, organizations need to implement structured availability practices:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>No Decisions Without Documentation:</strong> Establish a rule that decisions aren't final until documented in a shared, accessible location</li>
        <li><strong>End Email Knowledge Bases:</strong> Set a policy that substantive information in emails must be transferred to proper documentation systems</li>
        <li><strong>Eliminate Personal Storage for Business Information:</strong> Prohibit the use of personal accounts for storing work information</li>
        <li><strong>Default Open Access Policies:</strong> Make information available to all employees by default, restricting only when there's a specific reason</li>
        <li><strong>Create Official Knowledge Repositories:</strong> Establish clear, well-structured systems where information should live</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Knowledge Audits:</strong> Systematically look for "dark knowledge" that exists only in restricted locations and bring it into the light</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The most effective solution is cultural: make documentation and knowledge sharing part of everyone's job, not an afterthought. Information that authorized employees can't find might as well not exist—and the organization will pay the integrity price.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Information Needs to Flow to Those Who Need It</h2>
      
      <p>Every time someone hides information in personal storage, restricted channels, or undocumented meetings, they're creating future integrity problems. They're ensuring that decisions will be made with incomplete information, systems will be built without important context, and work will be duplicated unnecessarily.</p>
      
      <p>Information availability isn't just about system uptime—it's about ensuring organizational knowledge flows to everyone who legitimately needs it to do their jobs. Without this flow, data integrity inevitably suffers as people work in the dark.</p>
      
      <p>Remember: The best security policy in the world is worthless if it's stored in someone's personal email. The most brilliant architecture decision is useless if it's only shared in a meeting with no minutes. And the most carefully crafted standard is pointless if it's hidden in a SharePoint site no one can access.</p>
      
      <p>Stop information hoarding—your data integrity depends on it.</p>
