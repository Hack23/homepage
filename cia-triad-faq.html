      <h2>Understanding the CIA Triad</h2>
      <p>The CIA Triad is the foundation of modern information security, providing a framework for evaluating and implementing security measures across organizations of all sizes. This FAQ answers common questions about its principles, implementation, and best practices.</p>

        <h3>What is the CIA Triad in information security?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The CIA Triad is a fundamental security model consisting of three core principles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Guaranteeing data accuracy and trustworthiness throughout its lifecycle</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These three principles form the foundation for developing security policies, selecting controls, and assessing an organization's security posture.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does data classification relate to the CIA Triad?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Data classification is directly linked to the CIA Triad by helping organizations determine appropriate security controls based on data sensitivity:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Classification levels (e.g., public, internal, confidential, restricted) determine access controls</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> More sensitive classifications may require stricter validation, checksums, or approval workflows</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Critical data classifications often require redundancy and higher uptime requirements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By classifying data, organizations can apply proportionate security controls across all three dimensions of the CIA Triad.</p>
