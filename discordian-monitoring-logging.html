            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. But log everything anyway."</em></p>

            <h2>🔍 The Problem: Security Events Nobody Sees</h2>
            
            <p>If a tree falls in the forest and nobody logs it, <strong>it still fell</strong>. But you'll never prove it. You'll never know when. You'll never know why. And when the auditor asks, you'll look stupid.</p>
            
            <p>Detection requires visibility. Visibility requires logging. Logging requires storage. Storage requires money. Money requires justification. And around we go.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> If a tree falls in the forest and nobody logs it, it still fell. But you'll never prove it. Log everything. Review intelligently.
            </div>

            <h2>📊 The Five Categories of "What to Watch"</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Authentication Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>Who's trying to get in?</strong></p>
                    <p>Logins, failures, lockouts, privilege escalations. If someone's trying to become root at 3 AM, that's worth knowing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Authorization Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>Who's accessing what?</strong></p>
                    <p>File access, permission changes, access denials. When your intern tries to read the CEO's email, notice.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. System Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>What's the infrastructure doing?</strong></p>
                    <p>Service starts/stops, configuration changes, resource exhaustion. Servers don't reboot themselves (usually).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Network Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>What's flowing where?</strong></p>
                    <p>Traffic patterns, blocked connections, anomalies. 50GB outbound to Romania at midnight? Interesting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Application Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>What are your apps actually doing?</strong></p>
                    <p>Transactions, errors, security events. SQL injection attempts show up here if you're logging properly.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> The log you didn't think to collect is the one that would have shown the breach. Log everything. Storage is cheaper than incident response.
            </div>

            <h2>⚖️ The Logging Triad: Collect, Retain, Review</h2>
            
            <h3>Collect Everything (Almost)</h3>
            <p>Log authentication, authorization, configuration changes, security events, and errors. Don't log passwords or credit cards—that's just creating new problems.</p>
            
            <h3>Retain Intelligently</h3>
            <p>Hot storage: 30-90 days for investigation. Cold storage: 1-7 years for compliance. Forever storage: Not a thing unless you hate money.</p>
            
            <h3>Review Actually</h3>
            <p>SIEM systems that nobody monitors are expensive screensavers. Alerts that nobody responds to train attackers that they're invisible.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> A SIEM that generates 10,000 alerts per day is an untuned SIEM. Signal requires noise reduction. Tune or drown.
            </div>

            <h2>🚨 Detection vs. Prevention: Both Required</h2>
            
            <p>Prevention is ideal. Detection is necessary. You can't prevent everything—budget, complexity, and reality intervene. But you can detect everything if you log it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Stop attacks before they succeed.<br>
            <strong>Detection:</strong> Notice attacks while they're happening.<br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> Stop attacks after they start.<br>
            <strong>Recovery:</strong> Fix what broke.</p>
            
            <p>You need all four. Prevention alone is optimism. Detection alone is archaeology. Choose balance.</p>

            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            
            <p>Our monitoring and logging strategy is public (of course): <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Centralized logging</strong> - CloudWatch, Splunk, or similar SIEM</li>
                <li><strong>Log retention</strong> - 90 days hot, 1 year cold, 7 years compliance</li>
                <li><strong>Alerting</strong> - Security events, authentication failures, config changes</li>
                <li><strong>Regular review</strong> - Weekly for anomalies, daily for critical alerts</li>
                <li><strong>Incident correlation</strong> - Link logs to incident response timelines</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> If you're not reviewing logs, you're just collecting evidence for the attacker's trial. Detective controls require detection. Detection requires looking.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: See to Believe</h2>
            
            <p>You can't defend what you can't see. You can't see what you don't log. You can't log what you don't configure. And you can't respond to what you don't review.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Monitoring and logging aren't optional—they're foundational.</strong> Prevention fails. Detection catches failure. Response limits damage. This is the cycle.</p>
            
            <p>Log everything. Review intelligently. Respond quickly. Or find out the hard way that the breach happened six months ago and you never noticed.</p>
