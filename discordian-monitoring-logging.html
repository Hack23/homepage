            <h1>Monitoring & Logging: If a Tree Falls and Nobody Logs It...</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. But log everything anyway."</em></p>

            <h2>🔍 The Problem: Security Events Nobody Sees (Until Too Late)</h2>
            
            <p>If a tree falls in the forest and nobody logs it, <strong>it still fell</strong>. But you'll never prove it. You'll never know when. You'll never know why. And when the auditor asks, you'll look stupid. <strong>FNORD—and when the breach happens, you'll learn you had zero visibility into the compromise that happened six months ago.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Detection requires visibility. Visibility requires logging. Logging requires storage. Storage requires money. Money requires justification. And around we go. <strong>Are you paranoid enough to log everything before you need it? Most people aren't. That's why most breaches surprise them.</strong></p>
            
            <p>At Hack23, comprehensive monitoring is non-negotiable: <strong>AWS cloud-native observability stack.</strong> CloudWatch Logs for application and system events. CloudTrail for all AWS API calls (immutable audit trail). GuardDuty for ML-powered threat detection. Security Hub for finding aggregation. VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis. <strong>Nothing is true—especially claims of "no suspicious activity" when you're not even looking.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Our monitoring strategy spans <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Network_Security_Policy.md">Network Security Policy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Secure_Development_Policy.md">Secure Development Policy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Security_Metrics.md">Security Metrics</a>—because monitoring isn't one policy, it's foundational to everything. <strong>Everything is permitted—including attackers operating undetected because you weren't watching.</strong></p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> If a tree falls in the forest and nobody logs it, it still fell. But you'll never prove it. Log everything. Review intelligently. AWS makes this default—comprehensive logging is table stakes, not optional. <strong>FNORD—the attack you didn't log is the breach you can't explain. Are you paranoid enough to assume attackers are already inside? You should be.</strong>

            <h2>📊 The Five Categories of "What to Watch" (AWS Edition)</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Authentication Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>Who's trying to get in?</strong></p>
                    <p>AWS Identity Center login attempts, MFA challenges, failed authentications. CloudTrail logs all IAM actions. GuardDuty detects credential compromise.</p>
                    <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>If someone's trying to become root at 3 AM, CloudWatch Alarms notify immediately.</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Authorization Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>Who's accessing what?</strong></p>
                    <p>IAM policy evaluations, S3 bucket access, Lambda invocations. CloudTrail records all API calls with request/response details. Access denied events trigger investigation.</p>
                    <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>When attempts fail, logs show who tried and what they wanted. Success AND failure matter.</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. System Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>What's the infrastructure doing?</strong></p>
                    <p>Lambda function starts/stops, RDS instance changes, configuration modifications. CloudWatch Logs capture all application output. AWS Config tracks resource changes.</p>
                    <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Servers don't reconfigure themselves (usually). Config drift detection identifies unauthorized changes.</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Network Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>What's flowing where?</strong></p>
                    <p>VPC Flow Logs capture all network traffic. Source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, accept/reject decisions. GuardDuty analyzes flow patterns for threats.</p>
                    <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>50GB outbound to Romania at midnight? VPC Flow Logs + GuardDuty alert within minutes.</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Application Events</h3>
                    <p><strong>What are your apps actually doing?</strong></p>
                    <p>Application logs to CloudWatch Logs. Transaction records, errors, security events. SQL injection attempts, authentication failures, API errors all logged.</p>
                    <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Application-level security events show attacks that passed network controls. This is where attacks often appear first.</em></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> The log you didn't think to collect is the one that would have shown the breach. AWS defaults to comprehensive logging—CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, CloudWatch all standard. Storage is cheaper than incident response. Enable everything.
            </div>

            <h2>⚖️ The Logging Triad: Collect, Retain, Review</h2>
            
            <h3>Collect Everything (AWS Makes This Easy)</h3>
            <p>Log authentication (IAM, Identity Center), authorization (API calls), configuration changes (AWS Config), security events (GuardDuty), and errors (CloudWatch Logs). Don't log passwords or credit cards—that's just creating new problems. AWS services log to CloudWatch/CloudTrail by default.</p>
            
            <h3>Retain Intelligently (By Classification)</h3>
            <div class="cards">
                <div class="card confidentiality-card">
                    <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
                    <h3>📦 Hot Storage: 90 Days</h3>
                    <p>CloudWatch Logs, immediately queryable. Active investigation and incident response. CloudWatch Logs Insights for analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Security incidents, performance debugging, compliance checks</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card integrity-card">
                    <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
                    <h3>🧊 Cold Storage: 1 Year</h3>
                    <p>S3 archival, cost-optimized. Historical analysis and compliance audits. Glacier for long-term retention.</p>
                    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Annual audits, trend analysis, regulatory requirements</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card availability-card">
                    <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
                    <h3>♾️ Forever Storage: Not A Thing</h3>
                    <p>Unless you hate money. Retention policies enforce deletion. Compliance determines duration, not sentiment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Most logs have diminishing value after 1 year. Delete strategically.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Review Actually (Automated Where Possible)</h3>
            <p>GuardDuty analyzes logs automatically using machine learning. Security Hub aggregates findings from multiple sources. CloudWatch Alarms trigger on suspicious patterns. Manual review for complex investigations, but automated detection for known threats.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Response Times (Per Incident Response Plan):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Critical incidents:</strong> &lt;30 minutes detection, &lt;4 hours resolution</li>
                <li>🟠 <strong>High incidents:</strong> &lt;1 hour detection, &lt;24 hours resolution</li>
                <li>🟡 <strong>Medium incidents:</strong> &lt;4 hours detection, &lt;72 hours resolution</li>
                <li>🔵 <strong>Low incidents:</strong> &lt;24 hours detection, &lt;1 week resolution</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> A SIEM that generates 10,000 alerts per day is an untuned SIEM. Signal requires noise reduction. GuardDuty reduces noise through ML. Tune CloudWatch Alarms. Prioritize by impact. Or drown in alerts nobody reads.
            </div>

            <h2>🚨 Detection vs. Prevention: Both Required</h2>
            
            <p>Prevention is ideal. Detection is necessary. You can't prevent everything—budget, complexity, and reality intervene. But you can detect everything if you log it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Stop attacks before they succeed.<br>
            <strong>Detection:</strong> Notice attacks while they're happening.<br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> Stop attacks after they start.<br>
            <strong>Recovery:</strong> Fix what broke.</p>
            
            <p>You need all four. Prevention alone is optimism. Detection alone is archaeology. Choose balance.</p>
