Some data like committee meetings and government decisions may have slight delays based on official publication schedules. The platform prioritizes accuracy over real-time updates, ensuring all data is properly validated and processed before display. Users can see the last update timestamp for each dataset.

The platform is optimized for Swedish political structures, data sources, and parliamentary procedures. However, as an open-source project, the underlying technology and methodologies could be adapted for other countries with similar open data availability. The codebase is available on GitHub, allowing developers in other countries to fork the project and customize it for their national political systems. The key requirement is access to structured government data APIs and official public records. The project has been featured in international studies on parliamentary monitoring as a model for democratic transparency platforms. While expansion to other Nordic countries is conceptually possible, it would require significant development effort and access to equivalent data sources."
