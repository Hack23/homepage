- Cost: €30-40
- Quality: 75-80% (good starting point)

**Step 2: Technical Review (6-10 hours)**

### Priority 2: Hreflang Completion (14 files)

**Impact:** +5% quality score (85% → 90%)  
**Effort:** 2-4 hours (can be automated)  
**Cost:** Minimal

#### Files Needing Hreflang Tags:

Complete hreflang set requires 29 tags per file (14 languages + regional variants + x-default).

Files with incomplete hreflang tags (<29):
1. cia-triad-faq_es.html (24 tags - needs 5 more)
2. discordian-access-control_es.html (19 tags - needs 10 more)
3. discordian-asset-mgmt_es.html (10 tags - needs 19 more)
4. discordian-business-continuity_es.html (10 tags - needs 19 more)
5. discordian-compliance-frameworks_es.html (16 tags - needs 13 more)
6. discordian-compliance_es.html (16 tags - needs 13 more)

14. discordian-secure-dev_es.html (12 tags - needs 17 more)
15. projects_es.html (15 tags - needs 14 more)

#### Recommended Approach:

Create automated script to add missing hreflang tags based on index_es.html template. Script should:
1. Detect current hreflang tags in file
2. Compare against standard 29-tag template
3. Add missing language variants
4. Validate format and URLs

**Effort:** 2-4 hours to create and run script  
**Cost:** Minimal (in-house development)

### Priority 3: Native Speaker Polish (45 files)

**Impact:** +5-10% quality score (90% → 95%+)  
**Effort:** 10-15 hours professional review  
**Cost:** €250-350

#### Scope:

45 files have good Spanish translation but would benefit from:
- Professional terminology verification
- Cultural adaptation for Spain/LATAM markets
- Style consistency improvements
- Grammar and fluency refinement

#### Recommended Process:

1. **Batch Review (8-10 hours)**
   - Native Spanish speaker reviews all 45 files
   - Focuses on fluency, terminology, cultural fit
   - Documents improvement suggestions

2. **Edits & Refinement (2-5 hours)**
   - Apply review feedback
