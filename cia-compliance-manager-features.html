        <h2>Security Assessment Levels</h2>
        <p>The CIA Compliance Manager helps you assess and implement the appropriate security level for your organization's needs. Each level represents a different investment and protection balance:</p>
        <div class="cards">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
            <h3>Basic Level</h3>
            <p>Minimal investment, low protection, and higher risk of downtime or data breaches. Suitable for non-critical or public-facing systems with limited sensitive data.</p>
            <p><strong>For Analysts:</strong> A baseline starting point for developing more robust security postures.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="card">
            <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
            <h3>Moderate Level</h3>
            <p>A balanced approach to cost and protection, good for mid-sized companies that need compliance without overspending on redundant systems.</p>
            <p><strong>For Analysts:</strong> The most common target for organizations balancing security with operational needs.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="card">
            <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
            <h3>High Level</h3>
            <p>Required for businesses where data integrity, uptime, and confidentiality are critical. Higher costs, but justified in regulated industries like finance, healthcare, or e-commerce.</p>
            <p><strong>For Analysts:</strong> Essential for regulated environments and high-value data protection.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="card">
            <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
            <h3>Very High Level</h3>
            <p>Over-the-top protection and availability designed for mission-critical systems, such as those in defense or high-security finance. Extremely high CAPEX and OPEX.</p>
            <p><strong>For Analysts:</strong> Reserved for the most critical national security and financial systems.</p>
