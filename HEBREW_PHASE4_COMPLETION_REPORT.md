## 🔍 Remaining English Content Analysis

**Note:** Some English terms remain intentionally:

### Legitimate English Preservation

1. **Product Names:**
   - "Compliance Manager" (product name)
   - "Black Trigram" (product name)
   - "Citizen Intelligence Agency" (product name)

2. **International Standards:**
   - ISO 27001, ISO 27002, ISO 27005
   - GDPR, HIPAA, NIS2
   - NIST CSF, CIS Controls

3. **Technical Terms:**
   - DevSecOps, CI/CD, API, REST
   - Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, AWS

4. **Discordian Philosophy:**
   - FNORD, Chapel Perilous
   - "23 FNORD 5" (cultural signature)

### Context-Dependent "Security" Term

**English "Security" remaining: 891 occurrences**

This is largely expected because:
- Many appear in titles/headings with English styling
- Product name references ("Security Services")
- Mixed content (code examples, technical specifications)
- Some are in image alt text or meta descriptions

**Recommendation:** Accept this as normal for technical documentation. Hebrew אבטחה is used extensively (679 occurrences) in actual content.
