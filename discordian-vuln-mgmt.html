      <h2 class="panel-caption">Known Vulns Are Inexcusable</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Except not patching Log4Shell—that's just negligence.</p>
      
      <p><em>Think for yourself. Question authority.</em> But don't question whether you should patch critical CVEs.</p>
      
      <p>Zero-days exist. You can't patch what you don't know. But <strong>known vulnerabilities</strong>? Those are on you. Unpatched CVEs are just pre-installed backdoors with better PR.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ILLUMINATION: Unpatched vulnerabilities are just pre-installed backdoors with better PR.</em></p>
      
      <p>Here's how we manage vulns without losing our minds. Full details in our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Vulnerability_Management.md">public Vulnerability Management Policy</a>:</p>
    </section>

    <section id="five-steps">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Steps of Not Getting Pwned By Known Vulns</h2>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. Discover</h3>
          <p>You can't fix what you don't know exists. Asset inventory, vulnerability scanning, dependency checking. Know what you're running.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Shadow IT is just vulnerabilities you don't know about yet.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Assess</h3>
          <p>CVSS scores are guidance, not gospel. Consider exploitability, exposure, impact to <em>your</em> environment. Context matters.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>CVSS 10.0 on an air-gapped system is less urgent than CVSS 7.0 on your internet-facing API.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Prioritize</h3>
          <p>You can't patch everything at once. Triage: Critical first, then high, then medium. Low when you have time. (You won't have time.)</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Perfect is the enemy of patched. Patch critical first, optimize later.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Remediate</h3>
          <p>Patch, mitigate, or accept. Patch is best. Mitigation (WAF, network segmentation) is temporary. Acceptance better be documented.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Accepted risk is management's problem. Unmanaged risk is your problem at 3am.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. Verify</h3>
          <p>Did the patch actually apply? Is the vuln actually gone? Rescan, validate, confirm. Trust, but verify. Mostly verify.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>An unverified patch is Schrödinger's security—both applied and not applied until you check.</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <section id="cvss">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">CVSS: Guidance, Not Gospel</h2>
      
      <p>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides standardized severity ratings. It's useful. It's not perfect. It lacks <em>your</em> context:</p>
      
      <table class="data-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>CVSS Score</th>
            <th>Severity</th>
            <th>SLA Example</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr class="roi-exceptional">
            <td><strong>9.0-10.0</strong></td>
            <td>Critical</td>
            <td>Patch within 24-48 hours</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="roi-high">
            <td><strong>7.0-8.9</strong></td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Patch within 1 week</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="roi-moderate">
            <td><strong>4.0-6.9</strong></td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>Patch within 1 month</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="roi-basic">
            <td><strong>0.1-3.9</strong></td>
            <td>Low</td>
            <td>Patch in next maintenance window</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      
      <p><strong>But context matters:</strong> Internet-facing? Actively exploited? Exploit code public? Data sensitivity? Adjust accordingly.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>META-ILLUMINATION: CVSS tells you how bad the vuln is. You tell CVSS how bad it is for you.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="patch-process">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Patch Process: Speed Balanced With Stability</h2>
      
      <p>Patching is balancing act—speed vs stability:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critical Systems</strong> — Test quickly, deploy fast. Risk of patch &lt; risk of exploit.</li>
        <li><strong>Production Systems</strong> — Test in staging, deploy in maintenance windows. Minimize user impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Patches</strong> — For actively exploited zero-days. Deploy fast, roll back if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Rollback Plan</strong> — Always have one. Patches break things. Be ready to revert.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Operation Mindfuck the attackers:</strong> Patch faster than they can weaponize.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>CHAOS ILLUMINATION: The window between CVE publication and mass exploitation is shrinking. Patch faster.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="implementation">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Our Approach: Continuous Scanning, Rapid Response</h2>
      
      <p>At Hack23, vulnerability management is continuous:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automated Scanning</strong> — Weekly full scans, daily critical checks. Nessus, OpenVAS, or commercial tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependency Monitoring</strong> — Dependabot, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check. CVEs in libraries caught fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Patch Management</strong> — Automated where possible, manual where necessary. SLAs based on severity.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Patching</strong> — WAF rules for critical vulns that can't be patched immediately. Temporary only.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception Process</strong> — Can't patch? Document why, document mitigations, get management sign-off.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Full process in our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Vulnerability_Management.md">public Vulnerability Management Policy</a>—because transparency includes our patch failures too.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: Vulnerability Management Edition</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Except ignoring Log4Shell for six months—that's a breach waiting to happen.</p>
      
      <p>Vulnerability management is never "done." New CVEs every day. New attack vectors. New exploits. It's continuous vigilance or continuous compromise.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> CVSS is guidance. Your environment, your risks, your priorities. But patch the damn criticals.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION: You are now in Chapel Perilous. Every unpatched vuln is a loaded gun pointed at your infrastructure. How long before someone pulls the trigger?</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong></p>
      
      <p><em>"Think for yourself, schmuck! Question everything—except whether to patch actively exploited zero-days."</em></p>
