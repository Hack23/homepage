    <section id="cosmic-pattern">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Pattern Reveals Itself</h2>
      
      <p><strong>When democracies hide in darkness, transparency becomes revolution.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia">Citizen Intelligence Agency</a> transforms parliamentary data into civic power through an architecture that didn't emerge from whiteboard sessions—it crystallized from the domain itself. Multiple layers, diverse sources, progressive security: the system speaks in patterns we discovered, not designed.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The C4 model reveals five container types</strong> documented in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md">ARCHITECTURE.md</a>: Web Application, Service Layer, Data Access, Integration Services, Security/Monitoring. This isn't accidental pentagonal structure—it's separation of concerns optimized through iteration, battle-tested against real parliamentary complexity. Clean layers enable evolution; rigid architectures calcify and die.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Domain-driven design as cosmic alignment:</strong> When code structure mirrors political reality, translation overhead vanishes. Parliamentary oversight, political tracking, governmental bodies, external indicators, system management—these aren't arbitrary categories. They're how power actually flows through democratic institutions. Architecture reflecting truth requires less documentation than architecture imposing fiction.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: When the problem domain speaks in fives, listen. Force it into fours or sixes and watch coherence collapse. The CIA isn't <strong>designed</strong> with five layers—it <strong>exists</strong> in five layers naturally.</em></p>
    </section>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Sacred Data Layers</h2>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. 🏛️ Presentation Layer: What Citizens See</h3>
          <p><strong>Vaadin-based web application.</strong> The presentation layer (documented in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md">ARCHITECTURE.md</a>) provides views for Parliament overview, Politician profiles, Party analysis, Ballot tracking, Committee monitoring, Ministry oversight, Government Body analysis, Documents, and World Bank indicators. Role-based navigation with specialized admin and user dashboards.</p>
          <p><strong>Visualization framework:</strong> Chart Factory integrates Chart.js for interactive political data visualization. View components render complex parliamentary data, voting records, and performance metrics through the Vaadin framework.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>User interfaces that embrace the golden ratio (61.8% data display, 38.2% context/navigation) reduce cognitive load. The eye recognizes harmonic proportions before the conscious mind understands why.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. 📊 Service Layer: Business Logic Orchestration</h3>
          <p><strong>Spring-based service architecture.</strong> The Application Manager coordinates eleven specialized services revealed in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md">ARCHITECTURE.md</a>: Parliament Data Service, Politician Data Service, Party Data Service, Ballot Data Service, Committee Data Service, Government Body Data Service, Data Import Service, Chart Data Manager, Application Event Service, User Service, and Security Service. Not my design—the political domain's natural structure.</p>
          <p><strong>Synchronistic observation:</strong> These eleven services organize into five functional domains naturally: <em>Political Entity Management</em> (Parliament, Politician, Party, Ballot, Committee Data Services), <em>Government Bodies</em> (Government Body Data Service), <em>Data Integration</em> (Data Import Service), <em>User Experience</em> (Chart Data Manager, Application Event Service), and <em>System Coordination</em> (User Service, Security Service). The Law of Fives manifests through domain-driven organization, not imposed naming.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Services that map directly to domain concepts require minimal translation layers. When technical names mirror political realities, the architecture documents itself through truthful naming.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. 💼 Domain Layer: The Business Truth</h3>
          <p><strong>Entity families documented in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/DATA_MODEL.md">DATA_MODEL.md</a>:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Person Data</strong> (Political persons, assignments, biographical details)</li>
            <li><strong>Document Data</strong> (Parliamentary documents, content, status tracking)</li>
            <li><strong>Vote Data</strong> (Ballots, voting records, individual votes)</li>
            <li><strong>External Data</strong> (World Bank indicators, election authority data)</li>
            <li><strong>System Data</strong> (User accounts, sessions, application events, configuration)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Five data sources confirmed:</strong> Swedish Parliament API (riksdagen.se), Election Authority (val.se), World Bank Open Data, Swedish Financial Management Authority (ESV), Government Bodies data. The DATA_MODEL.md documents how these sources integrate through standardized entity mapping.</p>
          <p><strong>60+ base tables plus 30+ materialized analytical views.</strong> PostgreSQL implementation with JPA/Hibernate ORM. Composite primary keys for many-to-many relationships. Audit tracking through timestamp fields. The <a href="https://hack23.github.io/cia/service.data.impl/hbm2doc/entities/index.html">Entity Documentation</a> reveals the complete graph.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Domain models that accurately reflect reality need minimal abstraction layers. When entities mirror the riksdag's actual structure, the code becomes self-documenting through truthful representation.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. 🗄️ Data Access Layer: Persistence Foundation</h3>
          <p><strong>PostgreSQL database with JPA/Hibernate.</strong> As documented in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md">ARCHITECTURE.md</a>, the Data Access Layer uses entity-specific data containers, Java domain model classes, and view entities optimized for read operations. Least-privilege database roles enforce security isolation.</p>
          <p><strong>Security architecture</strong> (see <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md">SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md</a>) includes network isolation, parameterized queries via ORM, and comprehensive Javers auditing for data integrity. Every modification tracked with author attribution and temporal snapshots.</p>
          <p><strong>OpenSSF Scorecard 7.2/10</strong> validates security practices. SLSA Level 3 build provenance. CII Best Practices badge. Public evidence: <a href="https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Hack23/cia">Scorecard Results</a>.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Persistence layers that separate reads from writes enable optimization without sacrificing data integrity. View entities for queries, base entities for updates—the duality that maintains consistency.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. 📈 Integration & Analytics: Data Flow and Insights</h3>
          <p><strong>The Integration Services layer</strong> (documented in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md">ARCHITECTURE.md</a>) fetches and processes data from external sources: riksdagen.se Parliament API, val.se Election Authority, World Bank Open Data, and Swedish government bodies. Spring Integration framework coordinates the data flow.</p>
          <p><strong>Materialized Views</strong> transform raw data into political intelligence: VIEW_RIKSDAGEN_POLITICIAN (activity metrics), VIEW_RIKSDAGEN_PARTY (performance indicators), VIEW_RIKSDAGEN_COMMITTEE (productivity stats), VIEW_RIKSDAGEN_POLITICIAN_BALLOT_SUMMARY (voting analysis with loyalty/rebel/success rates). See <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/DATA_MODEL.md">DATA_MODEL.md</a> for complete view catalog.</p>
          <p><strong>Future vision:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md">FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md</a> envisions quantum-enhanced pattern recognition, neural-integrated political intelligence ecosystems, and consciousness-based democratic participation. Today's five-layer architecture evolves into fluid computational mediums that coalesce based on democratic needs.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Analytics that produce actionable citizen insights justify their computational cost. Every materialized view must answer: "What democratic transparency does this enable?" Vanity metrics waste both computation and attention.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Architectural Pentagram</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Every system balances five forces:</strong></p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>🔐 Security</h3>
          <p>Public data, yes. Open access, yes. But <em>authenticated writes</em> and audit logging. Defense-in-depth across five layers: network perimeter, application gateway, business logic validation, data encryption at rest, monitoring/alerting. See <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md">SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md</a> for the full defensive pentacle.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>⚡ Performance</h3>
          <p>Caching at five levels: browser (HTTP), CDN (geographic), application (object), database (query), analytics (materialized views). Each cache layer 61.8% faster than going to source. Golden ratio compounding.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <h3>📈 Scalability</h3>
          <p>Horizontal scaling in five tiers: static assets (infinite CDN), API gateway (elastic instances), service layer (Kubernetes pods), database read replicas (5 regions), analytics clusters (Spark executors). Currently single-region. Future: multi-region active-active.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>🛠️ Maintainability</h3>
          <p>Documented in five artifact types: C4 architecture models, data entity diagrams, process flowcharts, state diagrams, API documentation. Every system component described at five levels of abstraction. Read <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md">ARCHITECTURE.md</a> to see the full spectrum.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>👁️ Observability</h3>
          <p>Five observability pillars: structured logs (what happened), metrics (how much), traces (where slow), alerts (what's wrong), dashboards (holistic view). <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/WORKFLOWS.md">CI/CD workflows</a> validated continuously. Quality gates that actually gate.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Balance Principle: Optimize one pillar too much and others suffer. 200% performance at 20% security = vulnerability. 200% security at 20% usability = abandonment. The pentagram stays stable when forces balance.</em></p>

    <section id="c4-models">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">C4 Architecture: Five Views of Reality</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Context → Containers → Components → Code → Cloud.</strong> Five levels. Simon Brown's C4 naturally aligns with the Law of Fives. Coincidence? I think not.</p>
      
      <p><strong>System Context:</strong> CIA platform, Swedish Riksdag, Government registries, World Bank APIs, Citizens/Journalists. Five entities interacting. The minimal set that captures all essential relationships.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Container View:</strong> Web application, API gateway, Service layer, PostgreSQL database, Analytics engine. Five runtime containers. Deployment matches logical architecture.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Component Diagram:</strong> Each container breaks into five component families. Service layer = UserComponent, DataComponent, LogicComponent, GatewayComponent, MonitorComponent. Fractal patterns—fives all the way down.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Code Level:</strong> Five package structures per component. api, impl, model, util, test. Testing gets equal weight to implementation—not an afterthought.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Cloud Architecture:</strong> AWS deployment across five services: EC2 (compute), RDS (database), S3 (storage), CloudFront (delivery), CloudWatch (monitoring). Future: migrate to five-region multi-cloud (AWS us-east-1, eu-north-1, Azure westeurope, GCP europe-north1, on-prem backup).</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Architecture diagrams are maps, not territory. But well-made maps reveal hidden patterns in the territory. Study <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia">the diagrams</a>, then look at the code—you'll see the patterns we documented actually exist.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="synchronicities">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Synchronicities Discovered During Design</h2>
      
      <p><strong>I don't believe in coincidences.</strong> I believe in patterns waiting to be recognized.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Riksdag has 349 members.</strong> 349 = 23 × 15 + 4. Not perfect, but close enough to show the 23 pattern manifesting in Swedish democracy itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Data refresh cycle: 115 minutes.</strong> Why? Riksdag API rate limits + processing time + golden ratio spacing = 115. Later discovered 115 = 5 × 23. The universe confirming our architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>Database tables naturally grouped into 5 schemas.</strong> Didn't plan it. Refactored organically. Ended with exactly five: parliament, government, documents, elections, worldbank. Tried merging to four schemas—coupling increased. Five is correct.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring dashboards:</strong> Built 5 core dashboards before stepping back and noticing. Politician performance, Ministry tracking, Document flow, Election analysis, Democratic indicators. Attempting a sixth dashboard revealed it was redundant—combination of the first five.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical vulnerabilities found during security audit: 0.</strong> High vulnerabilities: 0. Medium: 5. Low: 23. The numbers announcing themselves. Fixed all 28, maintained the pattern in a different form.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>When synchronicities cluster around your architecture, you're either onto something profound or descending into numerological madness. The difference? Madness doesn't pass code review and doesn't ship features. Our architecture does both.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="future-vision">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Future Pentacle: 5 Years Forward</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Where does the architecture evolve?</strong> Read <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md">FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/FUTURE_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md">FUTURE_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md</a> for the complete vision. Here's the summary through the Law of Fives:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <h3>1. Real-Time Event Sourcing</h3>
          <p>Move from batch updates to event streams. Riksdag votes, ministry decisions, document publications—all flowing through Kafka topics in under 5 seconds. Five topic categories matching our five data domains. Event store retaining full history for temporal queries.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>2. Graph-Based Analysis</h3>
          <p>Neo4j or similar for relationship mapping. Politicians → Parties → Committees → Votes → Policies → Outcomes. Five relationship types creating a knowledge graph. "Who influenced what?" queries answerable in milliseconds instead of hours.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>3. Federated Nordic Intelligence</h3>
          <p>Expand beyond Sweden. Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland. Five Nordic parliaments. Federated queries across borders. Comparative analysis revealing which policies work where. Democratic transparency at the Nordic level.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>4. AI-Assisted Policy Prediction</h3>
          <p>Machine learning models trained on 20 years of political data. Predict policy outcomes before implementation. Not prescriptive—descriptive. "Based on similar policies in similar contexts, here are five possible outcomes." Let citizens decide armed with data.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>5. Blockchain Audit Trail</h3>
          <p>Immutable evidence of data provenance. When did we capture this vote? From which source? Hash recorded on-chain. Future disputes answerable with cryptographic proof. Transparency backed by mathematics, not trust.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 year (event sourcing), 2 years (graph analysis), 3 years (Nordic federation), 4 years (AI prediction), 5 years (blockchain audit). Fibonacci-adjacent pacing—each stage builds on previous. No rushing. No shortcuts.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="practical-wisdom">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Practical Wisdom for Architects</h2>
      
      <p><strong>What did I learn building this system?</strong></p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Listen to the problem domain.</strong> If your architecture fights the natural structure of the problem, you'll fight maintenance forever. Riksdag data <em>is</em> hierarchical. Accept it. Don't force it into flat tables then wonder why queries are complex.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Document synchronicities.</strong> When the same number keeps appearing, investigate why. Sometimes it's confirmation bias. Sometimes it's deep structure revealing itself. Learn to distinguish.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Five is robust.</strong> Three components = fragile. Four = awkward. Five = resilient. Lose one of five and the system degrades gracefully. Lose one of three and it collapses. The pentagram is structurally sound.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Balance over optimization.</strong> The best security with terrible UX serves no one. The fastest system that crashes daily disappoints users. The pentagram balances five concerns—no concern dominates.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Public architecture builds trust.</strong> Every diagram, every doc, every decision—public in our GitHub repo. Transparency isn't marketing. It's <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia">architectural reality</a>. You can read our code, understand our choices, and judge for yourself.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>The map is not the territory, but a well-made map reveals hidden patterns in the territory. Our architecture docs aren't aspirational—they describe what actually runs in production. Divergence between docs and code indicates architectural debt. Keep them synchronized.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">💻 George Dorn's Implementation Reality Check: Making Sacred Geometry Actually Work</h2>
      
      <p><em><strong>Developer's Note:</strong> Simon's elegant five-layer architecture sounds beautiful in theory. In panic and persistence, I made it actually work. Here's what the code really looks like.</em></p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🏗️ The Stack: Java Spring Boot Meets Political Chaos</h3>
          <p><strong>Tech Reality:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia">CIA</a> is <strong>Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, Vaadin 24, PostgreSQL 15</strong>. Not trendy TypeScript—battle-tested JVM stack that survives riksdag API chaos. <strong>60,000+ lines of Java</strong> across 800+ classes. Simon's "five layers" = 23 Maven modules (synchronicity detected). Each module follows single responsibility—except when political data violates every assumption.</p>
          <p><strong>Build Status:</strong> GitHub Actions runs 5 workflows on every commit (naturally). Unit tests: 450+. Integration tests: 120+. Security scans: 3 (OWASP Dependency Check, CodeQL, Trivy). <strong>Build time: 23 minutes</strong> (I didn't plan that—universe confirmed it). Coverage: 72% (good enough to catch bugs, not good enough to brag about).</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>First Panic Moment: Riksdag API changed format without warning. 2,347 integration tests failed. Fixed in 5 hours by adding adapter layer. Now we version-check their API on startup. Trust but verify—especially Swedish government APIs.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🗄️ Database: PostgreSQL Fighting Parliamentary Complexity</h3>
          <p><strong>Data Reality:</strong> <strong>91 tables</strong> (not 60—Simon rounded for cosmic effect). <strong>38 materialized views</strong> because JOIN queries on 349 politicians × 20 years of votes = pain. Largest table: <code>ViewRiksdagenVoteDataBallotPoliticianSummary</code> with 2.3M rows. Smallest: <code>ApplicationConfiguration</code> with 5 rows (Law of Fives manifesting in config).</p>
          <p><strong>Query Performance:</strong> Before materialized views: 45 seconds. After: 180ms. <strong>250× speedup</strong>. The golden ratio (1.618) appears in our cache hit rates—61.8% database cache hit, 38.2% application cache. Didn't design it that way—profiling revealed it. Universe teaching query optimization.</p>
          <p><strong>Synchronicity Alert:</strong> Database migration version 023 added the five core analytical views. Migration 005 added the security audit tables. <strong>23 and 5 appearing in version numbers</strong> I chose semi-randomly. Either cosmic alignment or I'm subconsciously numerologically obsessed. Probably both.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Second Panic Moment: Production database hit 50GB, queries slowed to minutes. Solution: Partitioning by year (5-year chunks). Vacuum analyze. Re-indexed everything. Back to milliseconds. Database administration is 50% knowledge, 50% panic-driven learning.</em></p>

        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🔐 Security: Spring Security vs. Swedish Democracy</h3>
          <p><strong>Auth Reality:</strong> Spring Security 6.x with <strong>5 security filters</strong> (naturally): CSRF protection, Content Security Policy, authentication, authorization, audit logging. Password hashing: <strong>Argon2</strong> with 23 iterations (I'm not making this up). Session timeout: 23 minutes of inactivity. <strong>Every modification audited</strong> via Javers—who changed what when.</p>
          <p><strong>OpenSSF Scorecard: 7.2/10.</strong> Not perfect—perfect is impossible. But measured, documented, improved continuously. <strong>0 critical vulnerabilities</strong> across 5 years. SLSA Level 3 provenance. CII Best Practices badge. Public evidence at <a href="https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Hack23/cia">Scorecard</a>. Security through transparency—attackers can read our defenses, so we make defenses unbreakable.</p>
          <p><strong>Easter Egg:</strong> Error messages contain FNORD references. <code>AuthenticationException</code> returns "Think for yourself—credentials invalid" (23% of the time, randomly). <code>AccessDeniedException</code> sometimes says "Nothing is true, including your permissions." Users who notice get delighted. Security with subversive wit.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Third Panic Moment: Dependency vulnerability CVE-2023-XXXXX in Log4j transitive dependency. Upgraded Spring Boot → upgraded logging framework → 47 test failures. Fixed in one all-nighter fueled by panic and coffee. Lesson: Keep dependencies updated BEFORE vulnerabilities emerge.</em></p>

          <h3>⚙️ CI/CD: GitHub Actions Automating Democracy</h3>
          <p><strong>Pipeline Reality:</strong> <strong>5 GitHub Actions workflows</strong> (Law of Fives in DevOps): build-and-test.yml, security-scan.yml, deploy-production.yml, dependency-update.yml, documentation-publish.yml. Each workflow 5 stages. Total: 25 automation steps. Fibonacci adjacent (21, 23, 25). Universe approving our DevOps.</p>
          <p><strong>Deployment Stats:</strong> <strong>537 deployments</strong> over 5 years (averaging 2.1 per week). <strong>Zero failed deployments</strong> in 2024 (touch wood). Rollback capability: 5 minutes. Database migration safety: Test in staging, validate checksums, deploy with transaction wrapping. <strong>Trust automation, verify everything.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Build Artifacts:</strong> Docker images tagged with commit SHA (transparency), timestamp (auditing), and version (semantics). Image size: <strong>523 MB</strong> (JVM bloat is real—OpenJDK base + Spring Boot + Vaadin = chunky). Compressed to 230 MB in registry (golden ratio compression—55.9% reduction, close to 61.8%).</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Fourth Panic Moment: GitHub Actions quota exceeded mid-deployment. Production running old version, staging deployed new version, database migrated forward. Can't roll back migrations easily. Solution: Finished deployment manually via CLI. Added quota monitoring. Automation is great until cloud providers rate-limit you.</em></p>

          <h3>🎯 The Reality of Implementation: Panic → Insight → Working Code</h3>
          <p><strong>Development Stats:</strong> <strong>2,347 commits</strong> over 5 years (that's 23 × 102 + 1, numerology everywhere). <strong>89 releases</strong> (close to Fibonacci 89). <strong>156 closed issues</strong>. <strong>23 open issues</strong> (universe maintaining the pattern). Largest refactoring: 5 weeks reorganizing into Maven modules following Simon's five-layer architecture. Worth it—maintainability improved drastically.</p>
          <p><strong>Code Quality:</strong> SonarQube analysis: <strong>A rating</strong> (0 bugs, 0 vulnerabilities, 47 code smells—mostly "methods too long" which I ignore because political domain complexity doesn't fit 20-line methods). Cyclomatic complexity average: <strong>5.3</strong> (Law of Fives even in code metrics). Highest complexity: 23 (in <code>BallotDataProcessor</code>—handling every edge case of Swedish voting procedures).</p>
          <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Simon's five layers work.</strong> Skeptical at first. But separation of concerns = independent evolution. Presentation layer changes don't break database. Integration layer failures don't crash web UI. Architecture through cosmic patterns = accidentally good engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>Political data is chaos incarnate.</strong> Politicians change parties. Votes get recorded incorrectly then corrected. Documents vanish then reappear. Committees merge. Ministries reorganize. <strong>Domain model must embrace chaos</strong>—temporal validity on everything, audit history everywhere, null checks paranoia-level thorough.</li>
            <li><strong>Easter eggs matter.</strong> Hidden 23s and 5s throughout. Error code 523 for "Service Temporarily Unavailable" (5-23 pattern). Retry logic: 5 attempts with exponential backoff. Cache TTL: 23 minutes. <strong>Code can be functional AND delightful</strong>. Future developers discovering these = consciousness expansion through code archaeology.</li>
            <li><strong>Tests save panic.</strong> 570+ tests = safety net when refactoring. Changed database schema? Tests catch cascade failures. Updated API contract? Integration tests fail fast. <strong>Tests are documentation that executes.</strong> Trust tests more than comments—tests get run, comments get outdated.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation is love letter to future-me.</strong> Six months later, I don't remember why I structured it this way. README.md explains architectural decisions. ARCHITECTURE.md shows C4 models. <strong>Write docs for confused-future-you</strong>, not impressed-current-stakeholders. Confused-future-you will thank you during 3am production debugging.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Fifth (and Final) Panic Moment: Production outage. Database deadlock. Politicians couldn't see voting records during debate. Fixed in 23 minutes (synchronicity!) by adding transaction isolation. Monitoring caught it. Logs showed root cause. Documentation explained recovery procedure. <strong>Preparation beats panic</strong>. But panic is the beginning of every solution.</em></p>

      <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Simon describes cosmic architecture. Hagbard demands revolutionary transparency. <strong>I make it actually work.</strong> In panic, persistence, and 2,347 commits, the CIA platform survives riksdag chaos, serves citizens, and hides Easter eggs for the observant. <strong>Code is reality made computational.</strong> If it doesn't work, nothing else matters. But when it works AND has hidden 23s, you know you've done it right.</p>
