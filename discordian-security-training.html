            <h2>Security Awareness Training: Teaching Humans Not to Click Shit (They'll Click It Anyway)</h2>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Don't click that link. (You're going to click it, aren't you? FNORD.)"</em></p>

            <h2>🧠 The Problem: Humans (The Meatware Vulnerability)</h2>
            
            <p>Humans are the weakest link in security. Not because they're malicious—because they're <strong>predictably irrational meat computers</strong> running wetware vulnerable to social engineering exploits that predate electricity. They click links. They reuse passwords. They hold doors for strangers with badges. They want to be helpful.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Social engineering works because humans are social.</strong> Phishing works because emails look legit. USB drops work because curiosity kills. Training helps. Slightly. <em>Are you paranoid enough yet?</em></p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Users will click anything. Train them anyway. Then assume they clicked it. <strong>Defense in depth means assuming users are already compromised</strong>—because statistically, someone is. Our 5-10% phishing simulation click rate is realistic, not aspirational—humans are human, not security appliances. <em>Welcome to Chapel Perilous. The paranoia is justified.</em>
            </div>

            <h2>🎓 The Five Topics Everyone Needs (To Ignore Before Clicking Anyway)</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Phishing Recognition</h3>
                    <p><strong>That email from your CEO? Not your CEO.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Training Content:</strong> Sender verification, URL inspection, urgent language red flags, attachment risks, social engineering tactics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> "CEO" requesting wire transfer to new vendor. Verify via secondary channel (phone call, in-person).</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> &gt;80% of phishing simulations reported within 5 minutes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Password Management</h3>
                    <p><strong>Password123 is not secure. Actually use the password manager.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Required Tools:</strong> Password manager (mandatory), MFA everywhere (enforced), biometric authentication (preferred).</p>
                    <p><strong>Standards:</strong> 16+ character passwords, unique per service, no reuse, no sharing, no sticky notes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> 100% MFA enrollment, password manager adoption tracking.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. Physical Security</h3>
                    <p><strong>Don't let strangers follow you inside. Don't plug in random USBs.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Home Office Security:</strong> Lock screens when away, secure WiFi (WPA3), physical device security, visitor awareness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real Threats:</strong> Tailgating, USB drops (BadUSB attacks), shoulder surfing, unattended devices.</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> Zero unattended unlocked devices, physical security incident reporting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Data Handling</h3>
                    <p><strong>Not everything goes to Dropbox. Understand classification.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Classification Training:</strong> Public, Low, Moderate, High, Very High, Extreme per <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md" target="_blank">Classification Framework</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Handling Requirements:</strong> Classify before sharing, encrypt sensitive data, use approved storage, no shadow IT.</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> >90% correct classification in knowledge checks, zero data spillage incidents.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Incident Reporting</h3>
                    <p><strong>Tell someone when things look weird. Early reporting limits damage.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Reporting Channels:</strong> Security incident form, direct CEO contact, incident response email, automated detection systems.</p>
                    <p><strong>What to Report:</strong> Suspicious emails, lost devices, potential breaches, security policy violations, anomalous behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>Response SLA (Service Level Agreement):</strong> &lt;30 minutes for critical incidents per <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Incident_Response_Plan.md" target="_blank">Incident Response Plan</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> &gt;95% of suspicious activities reported, &lt;5 minutes average report time.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> Security training isn't about making users security experts—it's about making them aware enough to ask questions before clicking. <strong>Perfect security training produces users who question everything, including training.</strong> Teach skepticism, not blind obedience. <em>Think for yourself, schmuck! The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.</em>
            </div>

            <h2>🎣 Phishing Simulations: Test Reality, Measure Improvement (Spoiler: Reality Sucks)</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Monthly phishing simulations with immediate feedback and zero punishment.</strong> Click = education. Report = recognition. Punishment makes people hide mistakes. Education makes people learn from them.</p>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>📊 Realistic Click Rate Expectations</h3>
                    <p><strong>Target: 5-10% click rate (realistic, not aspirational)</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Why Not 0%?</strong> If click rate is 0%, simulations aren't realistic enough. Attackers use sophisticated tactics—training must match.</p>
                    <p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Track click rates, report rates, time-to-report, repeat offenders, improvement trends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Industry Benchmark:</strong> Average click rate 20-30%. We target &lt;10% through continuous training.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>🎭 Simulation Scenarios</h3>
                    <p><strong>Rotate realistic attack types monthly:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CEO Fraud:</strong> Executive impersonation requesting urgent wire transfers</li>
                        <li><strong>IT Helpdesk:</strong> "Your password expires today" with credential phishing</li>
                        <li><strong>Invoice Scams:</strong> Fake vendor invoices with malicious attachments</li>
                        <li><strong>Credential Phishing:</strong> Fake login pages for commonly used services</li>
                        <li><strong>USB Drops:</strong> Physical USB devices in common areas (when applicable)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>⚡ Immediate Feedback Loop</h3>
                    <p><strong>Click = instant education. Report = positive reinforcement.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Click Response:</strong> Redirect to education page explaining attack indicators, provide learning resources, no shaming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Report Response:</strong> Confirmation message, recognition of good security behavior, contribution to security metrics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Personal security score (private), organization trends (aggregated), improvement tracking.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>📈 Continuous Improvement</h3>
                    <p><strong>Monthly review. Quarterly trend analysis. Annual program assessment.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Success Indicators:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Declining click rates over time (realistic target: &lt;10%)</li>
                        <li>Increasing report rates (target: >80% of phishing reported)</li>
                        <li>Decreasing time-to-report (target: &lt;5 minutes)</li>
                        <li>Fewer repeat offenders quarter-over-quarter</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Action Threshold:</strong> >15% click rate triggers additional targeted training.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Good simulations are realistic scenarios with immediate feedback and learning resources. Bad simulations are trick questions with public shaming and no follow-up. <strong>We choose education over punishment—because security culture beats security theater.</strong> Also, punishment makes people hide breaches instead of reporting them. <em>Are you paranoid enough to question your own security assumptions?</em>
            </div>

            <h2>📅 Training Frequency: Continuous, Not Annual Theater (Because Humans Forget)</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Annual security training is compliance theater.</strong> People forget. Threats evolve. Training once per year is like brushing your teeth once per year—ineffective and gross. <em>The Law of Fives applies: Five training vectors, five user types, five failure modes. Everything comes in fives if you look hard enough.</em></p>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Train, Test, Measure, Repeat (Welcome to Sisyphus's Security Department)</h2>
            
            <p>Humans will never be perfect security controls. They'll click links. They'll reuse passwords. They'll hold doors. <strong>Train them anyway.</strong> <em>Because the alternative is worse. Probably. Nothing is certain except entropy and exploitable humans.</em></p>
            
            <p>Security awareness training isn't about eliminating human error—it's about reducing it enough that other controls can compensate. <strong>Defense in depth includes educated users who:</strong> (1) fail slightly less often, (2) report failures faster, (3) question suspicious requests occasionally. <em>Low bar? Yes. Realistic? Also yes.</em></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recognize phishing</strong> with >80% accuracy and &lt;5 minute report time</li>
                <li><strong>Use password managers</strong> with 100% MFA enrollment and unique passwords</li>
                <li><strong>Handle data correctly</strong> with >90% classification accuracy and zero spillage</li>
                <li><strong>Report incidents promptly</strong> with >95% suspicious activity reporting</li>
                <li><strong>Question suspicious requests</strong> before acting, especially urgent wire transfers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Our training framework:</strong> Onboarding (mandatory) + Quarterly modules (focused) + Monthly phishing sims (realistic) + Incident-triggered (timely) + Role-specific (relevant) + Metrics-driven (measurable).</p>
            
            <p>Train continuously. Test regularly. Measure rigorously. Don't punish mistakes—learn from them. And assume users are compromised anyway, because eventually they will be. <strong>That's why defense in depth includes both educated users AND compensating controls.</strong> <em>Trust no one. Not even yourself. Especially not yourself.</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Training metrics we actually track:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>📊 Training completion: >95% target for all mandatory modules</li>
                <li>🎣 Phishing click rate: 5-10% realistic target (not aspirational 0%)</li>
                <li>📢 Report rate: >80% of phishing simulations reported</li>
                <li>⏱️ Time-to-report: &lt;5 minutes average for suspicious activities</li>
                <li>📈 Improvement trend: Declining click rates, increasing report rates quarter-over-quarter</li>
            </ul>
