            <h1>Security Awareness Training: Teaching Humans Not to Click Shit</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Don't click that link."</em></p>

            <h2>🧠 The Problem: Humans</h2>
            
            <p>Humans are the weakest link in security. Not because they're malicious—because they're human. They click links. They reuse passwords. They hold doors for strangers with badges. They want to be helpful.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Social engineering works because humans are social.</strong> Phishing works because emails look legit. USB drops work because curiosity kills. Training helps. Slightly.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Users will click anything. Train them anyway. Then assume they clicked it. Defense in depth means assuming users are already compromised. Our 5-10% phishing simulation click rate is realistic, not aspirational—humans are human, not security appliances.
            </div>

            <h2>🎓 The Five Topics Everyone Needs</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Phishing Recognition</h3>
                    <p><strong>That email from your CEO? Not your CEO.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Training Content:</strong> Sender verification, URL inspection, urgent language red flags, attachment risks, social engineering tactics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> "CEO" requesting wire transfer to new vendor. Verify via secondary channel (phone call, in-person).</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> &gt;80% of phishing simulations reported within 5 minutes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Password Management</h3>
                    <p><strong>Password123 is not secure. Actually use the password manager.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Required Tools:</strong> Password manager (mandatory), MFA everywhere (enforced), biometric authentication (preferred).</p>
                    <p><strong>Standards:</strong> 16+ character passwords, unique per service, no reuse, no sharing, no sticky notes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> 100% MFA enrollment, password manager adoption tracking.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. Physical Security</h3>
                    <p><strong>Don't let strangers follow you inside. Don't plug in random USBs.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Home Office Security:</strong> Lock screens when away, secure WiFi (WPA3), physical device security, visitor awareness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real Threats:</strong> Tailgating, USB drops (BadUSB attacks), shoulder surfing, unattended devices.</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> Zero unattended unlocked devices, physical security incident reporting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Data Handling</h3>
                    <p><strong>Not everything goes to Dropbox. Understand classification.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Classification Training:</strong> Public, Low, Moderate, High, Very High, Extreme per <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md" target="_blank">Classification Framework</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Handling Requirements:</strong> Classify before sharing, encrypt sensitive data, use approved storage, no shadow IT.</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> >90% correct classification in knowledge checks, zero data spillage incidents.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Incident Reporting</h3>
                    <p><strong>Tell someone when things look weird. Early reporting limits damage.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Reporting Channels:</strong> Security incident form, direct CEO contact, incident response email, automated detection systems.</p>
                    <p><strong>What to Report:</strong> Suspicious emails, lost devices, potential breaches, security policy violations, anomalous behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>Response SLA (Service Level Agreement):</strong> &lt;30 minutes for critical incidents per <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Incident_Response_Plan.md" target="_blank">Incident Response Plan</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Success Metric:</strong> &gt;95% of suspicious activities reported, &lt;5 minutes average report time.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> Security training isn't about making users security experts—it's about making them aware enough to ask questions before clicking. Perfect security training produces users who question everything, including training. Teach skepticism, not blind obedience.
            </div>

            <h2>🎣 Phishing Simulations: Test Reality, Measure Improvement</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Monthly phishing simulations with immediate feedback and zero punishment.</strong> Click = education. Report = recognition. Punishment makes people hide mistakes. Education makes people learn from them.</p>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>📊 Realistic Click Rate Expectations</h3>
                    <p><strong>Target: 5-10% click rate (realistic, not aspirational)</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Why Not 0%?</strong> If click rate is 0%, simulations aren't realistic enough. Attackers use sophisticated tactics—training must match.</p>
                    <p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Track click rates, report rates, time-to-report, repeat offenders, improvement trends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Industry Benchmark:</strong> Average click rate 20-30%. We target <10% through continuous training.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>🎭 Simulation Scenarios</h3>
                    <p><strong>Rotate realistic attack types monthly:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CEO Fraud:</strong> Executive impersonation requesting urgent wire transfers</li>
                        <li><strong>IT Helpdesk:</strong> "Your password expires today" with credential phishing</li>
                        <li><strong>Invoice Scams:</strong> Fake vendor invoices with malicious attachments</li>
                        <li><strong>Credential Phishing:</strong> Fake login pages for commonly used services</li>
                        <li><strong>USB Drops:</strong> Physical USB devices in common areas (when applicable)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>⚡ Immediate Feedback Loop</h3>
                    <p><strong>Click = instant education. Report = positive reinforcement.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Click Response:</strong> Redirect to education page explaining attack indicators, provide learning resources, no shaming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Report Response:</strong> Confirmation message, recognition of good security behavior, contribution to security metrics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Personal security score (private), organization trends (aggregated), improvement tracking.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>📈 Continuous Improvement</h3>
                    <p><strong>Monthly review. Quarterly trend analysis. Annual program assessment.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Success Indicators:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Declining click rates over time (realistic target: <10%)</li>
                        <li>Increasing report rates (target: >80% of phishing reported)</li>
                        <li>Decreasing time-to-report (target: &lt;5 minutes)</li>
                        <li>Fewer repeat offenders quarter-over-quarter</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Action Threshold:</strong> >15% click rate triggers additional targeted training.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Good simulations are realistic scenarios with immediate feedback and learning resources. Bad simulations are trick questions with public shaming and no follow-up. We choose education over punishment—because security culture beats security theater.
            </div>

            <h2>📅 Training Frequency: Continuous, Not Annual Theater</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Annual security training is compliance theater.</strong> People forget. Threats evolve. Training once per year is like brushing your teeth once per year—ineffective and gross.</p>

                <li><strong>Recognize phishing</strong> with >80% accuracy and <5 minute report time</li>
                <li><strong>Use password managers</strong> with 100% MFA enrollment and unique passwords</li>
                <li><strong>Handle data correctly</strong> with >90% classification accuracy and zero spillage</li>
                <li><strong>Report incidents promptly</strong> with >95% suspicious activity reporting</li>
                <li><strong>Question suspicious requests</strong> before acting, especially urgent wire transfers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Our training framework:</strong> Onboarding (mandatory) + Quarterly modules (focused) + Monthly phishing sims (realistic) + Incident-triggered (timely) + Role-specific (relevant) + Metrics-driven (measurable).</p>
            
            <p>Train continuously. Test regularly. Measure rigorously. Don't punish mistakes—learn from them. And assume users are compromised anyway, because eventually they will be. That's why defense in depth includes both educated users AND compensating controls.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Training metrics we actually track:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>📊 Training completion: >95% target for all mandatory modules</li>
                <li>🎣 Phishing click rate: 5-10% realistic target (not aspirational 0%)</li>
                <li>📢 Report rate: >80% of phishing simulations reported</li>
                <li>⏱️ Time-to-report: &lt;5 minutes average for suspicious activities</li>
                <li>📈 Improvement trend: Declining click rates, increasing report rates quarter-over-quarter</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Full training framework integrated into our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md" target="_blank">Information Security Policy</a>—because security through transparency means documenting how we actually train humans, not how we claim to.</p>
