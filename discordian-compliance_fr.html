    <h1 class="header">✅ Compliance: One Control, Multiple Frameworks, Zero Duplication</h1>

    <section id="intro">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Unified ISMS: When Framework Mapping Eliminates Compliance Theater</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including the permission to implement <strong>one security control that satisfies multiple compliance frameworks</strong> instead of treating ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and CIS Controls as separate universes requiring separate budgets and separate consultants billing separate hours. <em>Are you paranoid enough to question why compliance consultants profit from complexity while you drown in duplicative audits? The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy—and billing you for every expansion.</em></p>
      
      <p><em>Think for yourself, schmuck! Question authority.</em> Question consultants who sell separate "ISO 27001 program" and "NIST CSF program" and "CIS Controls program" when they're addressing the same security domains with 80% overlapping controls. <strong>The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.</strong> Don't feed it. Starve it through efficiency and watch compliance consultants panic when you implement once and map everywhere. <em>One control. Multiple frameworks. Zero duplication. Their nightmare. Your competitive advantage.</em></p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, compliance isn't separate programs—it's <strong>unified ISMS with systematic framework mapping.</strong> Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Compliance_Checklist.md">Compliance Checklist</a> maps single control implementations to multiple frameworks: <strong>93% ISO 27001 Annex A</strong> (106/114 controls), <strong>87% NIST CSF 2.0</strong> (108/124 subcategories), <strong>82% CIS Controls v8</strong> (135/164 safeguards).</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ILLUMINATION: Compliance frameworks aren't competing standards—they're different lenses on the same security reality. ISO 27001 control A.5.15 (access control) maps to NIST CSF PR.AC-04 (access control) maps to CIS Control 6 (access control). Same control, three compliance checkboxes. Consultants profit from treating these as separate because complexity billable. We profit from mapping because efficiency is competitive advantage. Follow the incentives, psychonaut.</em></p>
      
      <p>Our compliance framework demonstrates cybersecurity consulting expertise through <strong>efficiency gains:</strong> Single control implementation → multiple compliance outcomes. Audit prep time: 80 hours manual → 12 hours automated evidence collection.

          <h3>🏛️ ISO 27001:2022 Annex A</h3>
          <p><strong>Coverage: 93% (106/114 controls implemented)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Framework Purpose:</strong> International standard for Information Security Management Systems. Risk-based approach with 114 controls across 4 themes (Organizational, People, Physical, Technological). Gold standard for ISMS certification.</p>
          <p><strong>Implementation Status:</strong> 106 controls implemented, 8 not applicable (physical security for office-less company, outsourced development—no outsourcing). Evidence documented in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Compliance_Checklist.md">Compliance Checklist</a> with direct links to ISMS policies.</p>
          <p><strong>Coverage Highlights:</strong> A.5 (Organizational controls) 100%, A.6 (People controls) 91%, A.7 (Physical controls) 67% (office-less adjustments), A.8 (Technological controls) 97%.</p>
          <p><strong>Tool Support:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager">CIA Compliance Manager</a> tracks ISO 27001 Annex A control coverage with automated mapping to ISMS documentation.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ISO 27001 is comprehensive but not prescriptive. "Implement access control" doesn't specify how. That's feature, not bug. Allows tailoring to business context. Also allows consultants to charge €50K to tell you what "implement" means. We chose the free option: think for yourself.</em></p>

          <h3>🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0</h3>
          <p><strong>Coverage: 87% (108/124 subcategories addressed)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Framework Purpose:</strong> Risk-based framework organized by six Functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). Practical guidance with implementation tiers. Widely adopted in US federal agencies + critical infrastructure.</p>
          <p><strong>Implementation Status:</strong> 108 subcategories addressed across all six Functions. Govern (GV): 78%, Identify (ID): 89%, Protect (PR): 92%, Detect (DE): 84%, Respond (RS): 87%, Recover (RC): 81%. Full mapping in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Compliance_Checklist.md">Compliance Checklist</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Coverage Highlights:</strong> Strong Protect function (PR.AC access control, PR.DS data security, PR.PT protective technology). Detect function leveraging AWS services (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config). Response procedures with classification-driven SLAs.</p>
          <p><strong>Unique Value:</strong> NIST CSF provides implementation tiers (Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable, Adaptive) enabling maturity assessment. Hack23 targets Tier 3 (Repeatable) for critical controls, Tier 2 (Risk Informed) for standard controls.</p>

          <p><strong>Coverage: 82% (135/164 safeguards implemented)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Framework Purpose:</strong> Prioritized set of actions for cyber defense. 18 Controls with 164 Safeguards organized by Implementation Groups (IG1 basic, IG2 intermediate, IG3 advanced). Highly specific, actionable guidance.</p>
          <p><strong>Implementation Status:</strong> IG1 (essential cybersecurity) 94% (49/52 safeguards), IG2 (enterprise security) 86% (61/71 safeguards), IG3 (advanced security) 61% (25/41 safeguards). Full breakdown in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Compliance_Checklist.md">Compliance Checklist</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Coverage Highlights:</strong> CIS 1 (Inventory) via AWS Config, CIS 2 (Software) via Dependabot + SBOM, CIS 3 (Data Protection) via KMS encryption, CIS 4 (Secure Configuration) via CloudFormation IaC, CIS 5 (Account Management) via IAM policies, CIS 6 (Access Control) via least privilege + MFA.</p>
          <p><strong>Implementation Groups:</strong> IG1 focus (small business baseline) 94% complete. IG2 focus (enterprise capabilities) 86% complete. IG3 focus (advanced controls) 61% complete—intentional prioritization based on risk vs resource tradeoff.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>CIS Controls are specific: "Enable firewall logging" not "implement network security." Specificity reduces ambiguity but requires adaptation to cloud-native architectures (VPC Flow Logs vs traditional firewall logs).</em></p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: Compliance Mapping Edition</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including the permission to implement <strong>unified ISMS with systematic framework mapping</strong> instead of treating ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and CIS Controls as separate compliance programs.</p>
      
      <p>Traditional compliance: Separate programs for each framework, consultants billing separately, duplicate control implementations, 80%+ overlap ignored. Hack23 compliance: <strong>Single unified ISMS</strong> (one control implementation) → <strong>multiple framework mapping</strong> (ISO 27001 + NIST CSF + CIS Controls) → <strong>automated evidence collection</strong> (Config + CloudTrail + Security Hub) → <strong>continuous compliance</strong> (real-time posture visibility).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Our compliance framework:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Framework Coverage:</strong> 93% ISO 27001 (106/114 controls), 87% NIST CSF (108/124 subcategories), 82% CIS Controls (135/164 safeguards)</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Readiness:</strong> GDPR compliant, NIS2 ready, CRA prepared, UK DPDP reviewed. Single ISMS addresses multiple regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Framework Mapping:</strong> Single control implementation → multiple compliance outcomes. Access control satisfies ISO + NIST + CIS simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Automation:</strong> Continuous evidence collection via AWS services + GitHub + SonarCloud. 12 hours audit prep vs 80 hours manual.</li>
        <li><strong>Tool Support:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager">CIA Compliance Manager</a> for real-time compliance posture tracking across 40+ frameworks.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Question authority—including compliance consultants whose billable hours depend on treating overlapping frameworks as separate universes. Frameworks aren't competing standards. They're different perspectives on same security reality. Good security satisfies multiple frameworks, not separate programs. <em>ISO 27001 + NIST CSF + CIS Controls = same security, three compliance checkboxes. Consultants who can't see that overlap are either incompetent or incentivized. Guess which.</em></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>You are now in Chapel Perilous. Compliance without framework mapping is expensive theater. Compliance with systematic mapping is operational efficiency. We map once, comply multiple times. Because business value requires efficiency, not duplicate implementations. The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy—but only if you let it.</em></p>
