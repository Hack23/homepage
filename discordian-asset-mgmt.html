            <h1>Asset Management: You Can't Protect What You Don't Know You Have</h1>
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Shadow IT is shadow vulnerability."</em></p>
            <h2>📦 The Problem: Unknown Assets Are Unprotected Assets</h2>
            <p>You can't protect what you don't know you have. <strong>The server you forgot about is the one running an unpatched vulnerability from 2015.</strong> Shadow IT, BYOD, forgotten test servers—attack surface you don't track. Asset inventory is security foundation.</p>
            <div class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> The server you forgot about is the one running an unpatched vulnerability from 2015. Asset inventory prevents forgotten vulnerabilities.</div>
            <h2>🛡️ The Five Asset Categories</h2>
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card"><h3>1. Hardware</h3><p><strong>Servers, laptops, network equipment.</strong></p><p>Track locations, owners, configurations. Hardware inventory enables patching, replacement, disposal.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>2. Software</h3><p><strong>Applications, licenses, versions.</strong></p><p>What's installed? What's licensed? What's end-of-life? Software inventory enables vulnerability management.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>3. Data</h3><p><strong>Databases, files, backups.</strong></p><p>Where is sensitive data? Who owns it? How classified? Data inventory enables protection.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>4. People</h3><p><strong>Employees, contractors, vendors.</strong></p><p>Who has access? What permissions? Still employed? People inventory enables access control.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>5. Services</h3><p><strong>Cloud services, SaaS, APIs.</strong></p><p>What services in use? Who authorized? What data shared? Service inventory prevents shadow IT.</p></div>
            </div>
            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            <p>Our asset management is public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware inventory</strong> - All devices tracked, tagged, monitored</li>
                <li><strong>Software inventory</strong> - Automated scanning for installed software</li>
                <li><strong>Data classification</strong> - Sensitive data inventoried, classified</li>
                <li><strong>Access reviews</strong> - Quarterly review of who has what access</li>
                <li><strong>Service catalog</strong> - Approved cloud services, shadow IT monitoring</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Asset management isn't bureaucracy—it's knowing what to protect. Inventory everything or protect nothing effectively.</div>
            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Know Your Assets</h2>
            <p>You can't protect what you don't know you have. <strong>Inventory hardware, software, data, people, services.</strong> Update continuously. Or find out that forgotten assets were exploited assets.</p>
