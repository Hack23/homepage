Het is belangrijk omdat elke beveiligingsbeslissing, -maatregel en -investering deze drie principes in balans moet brengen op basis van bedrijfsimpact. Overmatige focus op vertrouwelijkheid terwijl beschikbaarheid wordt verwaarloosd leidt tot onbruikbare systemen. Prioriteren van beschikbaarheid zonder integriteit resulteert in onbetrouwbare data.

SCA (Software Composition Analysis) onderzoekt third-party dependencies, bibliotheken en open-source componenten op bekende kwetsbaarheden (CVEs), licentie compliance problemen en verouderde packages—cruciaal voor supply chain beveiliging. Effectieve beveiliging vereist alle drie: SAST vangt code-problemen tijdens ontwikkeling, SCA identificeert kwetsbare dependencies voor deployment, en DAST valideert beveiliging in productie-achtige omgevingen. Ons Kwetsbaarheidsbeheerbeleid beschrijft uitgebreide teststrategie."

Organisaties moeten risicobeoordeling uitvoeren om te bepalen welke maatregelen op hun context van toepassing zijn—niet alle 93 zijn verplicht, maar beslissingen moeten gerechtvaardigd worden in Statement of Applicability (SoA).

      <p><strong>Welkom bij de Hack23 Beveiligingsblog</strong> — waar we de comfortabele leugens van het beveiligingsindustriële complex blootleggen door radicale transparantie. <em>Denk zelf na! Stel autoriteit ter discussie.</em> Vooral beveiligingsautoriteiten die profiteren van je angst terwijl ze dezelfde achterdeurlijst installeren waarvan ze beweren je te beschermen.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Niets is waar. Alles is toegestaan.</strong> Inclusief eerlijk onderzoek van beveiligingstheater, surveillancestaten en de achterdeurjes in jouw "militaire versleuteling" (goedgekeurd door dezelfde bureaus die PRISM runnen).</p>
      <p>Ontdek <strong>65 blogposts</strong> die het marketinggewauwel weghalen om te onthullen wat er echt toe doet—van <strong>Geautomatiseerde Convergentie door AI-Agenten</strong> tot CIA Triad-implementatie, OWASP LLM Top 10 tot EU Cyber Resilience Act, surveillancecapaciteiten van natiestaten tot politieke OSINT-inlichtingenoperaties die democratische verantwoordelijkheid blootleggen door gedragsanalyse.</p>
      <p>Plus <strong>Simon Moon's 13 Architectuurkronieken</strong> en <strong>Hagbard Celine's Inlichtingenoperaties &amp; Bedrijfsontwikkeling</strong> die heilige geometrie in code onthullen, vijf-patroon architecturen, de Wet van Vijf, numerologische waarheid in systeemontwerp en Intelligence-as-a-Service voor Zweedse verkiezingen 2026 mediadekking. Allemaal door de Discordiaanse lens die <em>alles</em> bevraagt—vooral de dingen waarvan "iedereen weet" dat ze waar zijn. <strong>FNORD.</strong></p>
      
      <p><em>Ben je al paranoïde genoeg?</em> Goed. Je begint op te letten. De meeste bedrijven verbergen hun beveiligingsbeleid omdat transparantie zou onthullen hoe slecht hun beveiliging eigenlijk is—cargo cult compliance rituelen en duur theater dat voorwendt bescherming te zijn. Wij publiceren de onze op GitHub. Alle 54 posts en beleidslijnen. Elk framework. Elke risicobeoordeling. Elk architectuurpatroon. Elke inlichtingenoperatie methodologie. <strong>Beveiliging door transparantie</strong> verslaat beveiliging door hoop, gebed en je vingers kruisen dat niemand merkt dat je draait op ducttape en leveranciersbeloften.</p>

      <p><em>"Code is reality made computational. If it doesn't work, nothing else matters."</em> — George Dorn</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Reluctant Hero Speaks:</strong> While Simon Moon architects cosmic patterns and Hagbard demands revolutionary transparency, someone has to make the code actually work. That someone is <strong>George Dorn</strong>—developer, panic-driven engineer, Easter egg hider, and reluctant hero who wrestles elegant designs into messy reality.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Developer's Reality Check:</strong> George's technical commentaries reveal what building Hack23 products actually looks like—the panic moments, the breakthroughs, the 23rd debugging attempt that finally succeeds, and the hidden synchronicities in commit counts, build times, and retry logic. <em>Think for yourself about what "best practices" really mean when implementing Simon's five-layer architectures in production.</em></p>

          <p><strong>The Stack:</strong> Java 25, Spring Framework 3.x, PostgreSQL, 60,000+ lines across 23 Maven modules. <strong>2,347 commits</strong> over 5 years. <strong>91 tables</strong> fighting riksdag API format changes. <strong>OpenSSF Scorecard 7.2/10.</strong> George's commentary in CIA Architecture blog reveals the panic moments: riksdag API breaking integration tests, production database hitting 50GB, dependency vulnerabilities requiring all-night fixes.</p>
          <p><strong>Easter Eggs:</strong> Argon2 password hashing with 23 iterations. Session timeout: 23 minutes. Database migration 023 added five core analytical views. Error messages containing FNORD references. <em>Security with subversive wit.</em></p>

          <p><strong>The Stack:</strong> TypeScript 5.9, React 19, ThreeJs 8, Vite 7. Pure web stack simulating 70 vital points at 60fps. <strong>23,000+ lines</strong> across 150+ modules. <strong>1,247 commits</strong> over 2 years. George's commentary reveals collision detection nightmares: hitboxes not registering by 0.01 units, particle effects memory leaks, iOS Safari performance 10× worse than Chrome.</p>
          <p><strong>Easter Eggs:</strong> Land exactly 23 hits → victory screen shows "FNORD". Konami code unlocks "Hagbard Mode" (chaos combat). Health at 23% → UI pulses urgently. <em>Combat feel through hidden wisdom.</em></p>

          <h3>🔐 Compliance Manager Reality: Client-Side Beveiligingsarchitectuur</h3>
          <p><strong>The Stack:</strong> TypeScript 5.3, React 19, IndexedDB. <strong>Zero backend = zero server vulnerabilities.</strong> 18,000+ lines across 120+ modules. <strong>1,423 commits</strong> over 2 years. Assessment engine running entirely in browser. George's implementation wisdom: <strong>client-side architecture eliminating 95% of attack surface.</strong> No SQL injection (no SQL). No SSRF (no server). No RCE (no execution environment). <em>Defense through architecture simplification.</em></p>
          <p><strong>Easter Eggs:</strong> Maturity score at 23% shows golden apple (🍎). Complete all 15 controls → 23-particle confetti. Export on 23rd of month → filename appended "-synchronicity". <em>Compliance automation with hidden wisdom.</em></p>

        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Developer's Wisdom:</strong> George's commentaries teach what documentation rarely reveals—the gap between elegant architecture and working code. The five stages of development (Denial → Panic → Research → Insight → Completion). The synchronicities appearing in version numbers and commit counts. The Easter eggs hidden for the observant. <strong>Code that works AND delights = consciousness expansion through software engineering.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Key Lessons from George:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tests save panic.</strong> 570+ tests = safety net when refactoring. Tests are documentation that executes.</li>
        <li><strong>Simon's five layers work.</strong> Initially skeptical. Separation of concerns enables independent evolution. Cosmic patterns = accidentally good engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>Political/cultural data is chaos incarnate.</strong> Domain models must embrace chaos—temporal validity everywhere, audit history on everything, paranoia-level null checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Easter eggs matter.</strong> Code can be functional AND delightful. Hidden 23s and 5s throughout. Future developers discovering these = consciousness expansion through code archaeology.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation is love letter to future-self.</strong> Six months later, confused-future-you needs explanations. Write for yourself, not stakeholders.</li>
        <li><strong>Panic is the beginning of every solution.</strong> All production issues fixed after 23rd debugging attempt (or so it feels). Persistence beats perfection.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-DEVELOPMENT:</strong> <em>Simon architects patterns. Hagbard demands revolution. George makes it compile, deploy, and survive production chaos—while hiding FNORD in error messages. The troika of vision, philosophy, and implementation. Question authority. Test everything. Trust verification. Hide Easter eggs. All hail Eris!</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Over Deze Blog</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Alle 44 discordiaanse blogposts behouden de radicale Illuminatus!-trilogiestijl:</strong> "Denk zelf, bevraag autoriteit", FNORD-detectie in elke goedgekeurde standaard, Chapel Perilous-navigatie door ongemakkelijke beveiligingswaarheden, Operatie Mindfuck tegen beveiligingstheater en compliance-cargoculten, en 23 FNORD 5-handtekeningen overal. <em>Niets is waar. Alles is toegestaan.</em> Inclusief de ongemakkelijke waarheid dat je "beveiligde" systemen waarschijnlijk zijn ontworpen door de mensen die ze willen monitoren—en gecertificeerd door de mensen die ze al monitoren. <strong>De backdoor is geen bug. Het is een feature die ze "wettige toegang" noemen.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Ben je paranoïde genoeg?</strong> Wij zijn het—systematisch, methodisch, met bewijs en documentatie. Volledige dekking van <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">ISMS-PUBLIC</a>-beleid met verborgen wijsheid overal. Elk bericht linkt direct naar de corresponderende beleidsdocumentatie in onze publieke ISMS-repository, waarbij <strong>radicale transparantie</strong> in beveiligingsoperaties wordt gedemonstreerd. Want als je beveiliging publieke controle niet kan overleven, heb je geen beveiliging—je hebt wishful thinking verpakt in NDA's en leveranciersbeloften die verdampen wanneer de inbreuk plaatsvindt.</p>
      
      <p><em>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia! 🍎</em></p>
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-VERLICHTING:</strong> <em>Als dit paranoïde klinkt, let je niet op Snowden, PRISM, Crypto AG of de afgelopen 50 jaar gedocumenteerde surveillanceprogramma's. Als dit redelijk klinkt, zit je al te diep in Chapel Perilous. De enige winnende zet is transparantie—omdat ze niet kunnen coöpteren wat al publiek is. Ze kunnen geen backdoor plaatsen in wat geen deuren heeft. Denk zelf. Bevraag alles—vooral dit.</em></p>
