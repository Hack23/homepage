    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">It's Not "If"—It's "When" and "Are You Ready?"</h2>
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Security vendors sell "prevention." Reality teaches "detection and response."</p>
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including attackers getting in. <em>Plan for it.</em></p>
      <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Incident_Response_Plan.md">Incident Response Plan</a> is public because incident response through obscurity means the attackers know your plan better than you do.</p>
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Perfect prevention is impossible. Adequate response is mandatory. Choose mandatory over impossible.</em></p>
    </section>
    <section id="five-phases">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Phases of Not Completely Fucking Up</h2>
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>1. Preparation (Before the Breach)</h3>
          <p><strong>Practice.</strong> Test runbooks. Train responders. Build detection. <em>Hope is not a strategy.</em></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Incident response plans you've never tested are fan fiction.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>2. Detection (Shit Is Happening)</h3>
          <p><strong>Know when you're under attack.</strong> Logs. Alerts. Anomaly detection. The average dwell time is months. Be faster.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Breaches you don't detect are breaches attackers exploit fully.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <h3>3. Containment (Stop the Bleeding)</h3>
          <p><strong>Isolate compromised systems.</strong> Cut network access. Limit blast radius. <em>Fast containment beats perfect forensics.</em></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Forensic perfection while data exfiltrates is professional negligence.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>4. Eradication (Kill the Attacker's Access)</h3>
          <p><strong>Remove malware. Patch vulnerabilities. Rotate credentials.</strong> All of them. Assume everything is compromised.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Killing one backdoor when three exist is security theater with extra steps.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>5. Recovery (Back to Normal, But Smarter)</h3>
          <p><strong>Restore from clean backups. Verify integrity. Monitor harder.</strong> Post-incident review. Learn. Improve. Repeat.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Organizations that don't learn from incidents are destined to repeat them. Usually soon.</em></p>
        </div>

    <section id="when-to-panic">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">When to Panic vs When to Execute</h2>
      <p><strong>Don't panic:</strong> Panicking wastes time. Execute the plan you practiced.</p>
      <p><strong>Do panic:</strong> If you have no plan. Then panic, then write a plan, then practice it.</p>
      <p><strong>Question authority:</strong> Including your own assumptions during incidents. Verify everything. Trust nothing. Especially "it's probably fine."</p>
    </section>
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Incident Response Is Reality-Based Security</h2>
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> Chaos comes for everyone. Preparation decides if you survive.</p>
