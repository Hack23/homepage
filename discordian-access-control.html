    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">AWS Identity Center + 100% MFA Coverage: Trust No One (Including Yourself)</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> The phrase "trust but verify" is security dogma. Here's the truth: <strong>Just verify.</strong> AWS Identity Center SSO with mandatory MFA, 90-day dormant account reviews, and classification-driven access control.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Except access without authentication, authorization, and audit logging. Zero trust architecture with identity-centric security.</p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, access control demonstrates cybersecurity consulting expertise through systematic implementation: <strong>AWS Identity Center</strong> for centralized SSO, <strong>100% MFA coverage</strong> across all systems, <strong>90-day dormant account reviews</strong>, and <strong>classification-driven access matrices</strong> per our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md">Classification Framework</a>. Semi-annual review cycle (next: 2026-02-19). Version 2.2 effective 2025-08-20.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Trust is a vulnerability. Verification is a control. AWS Identity Center + mandatory MFA = verification at scale. Choose systematic controls over hopeful trust.</em></p>
      
      <p>Our approach combines zero trust principles with enterprise-grade identity management, proving that single-person companies can implement security controls that scale to enterprise engagements.

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Pillars of Zero Trust Access Control</h2>
      
      <p>"Zero trust" sounds paranoid. It's not. It's <strong>acknowledging reality through systematic implementation:</strong></p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. 🔐 Verify Every Request</h3>
          <p><strong>AWS Identity Center SSO with mandatory MFA.</strong> No implicit trust. No "you're on the VPN so you're good." Every access request gets challenged. Always. 100% MFA coverage target with real-time monitoring. Hardware MFA for critical systems (AWS root, financial), TOTP for development pipeline, platform native for marketing.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The network perimeter dissolved in 2010. Identity Center SSO means identity IS the perimeter. MFA enforces verification at every access.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. 📋 Classification-Driven Access</h3>
          <p><strong>Access control matrix aligned with Classification Framework.</strong> Extreme classification (AWS core infrastructure) = Identity Center SSO + hardware MFA + 4-hour timeout + monthly reviews. Very High (financial systems) = provider MFA + 1-hour timeout. High (dev pipeline) = platform MFA + 8-hour timeout + quarterly reviews. Systematic access based on data criticality.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Access privileges match data criticality. Financial systems get monthly reviews. Marketing platforms get annual. Classification drives everything.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. ⏰ 90-Day Dormant Account Reviews</h3>
          <p><strong>Automated detection, manual validation.</strong> Accounts unused >90 days flagged weekly. Target: 0 dormant accounts. Real-time alerting when threshold breached. Dormant accounts are privilege creep waiting to be exploited. Weekly monitoring prevents forgotten access from becoming attack vectors.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: If you can't detect malicious admin activity, you don't have security—you have hope. 90-day reviews mean systematic access hygiene, not annual cleanups.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. 🔄 Semi-Annual Policy Reviews</h3>
          <p><strong>Current version: 2.2 (Effective: 2025-08-20). Next review: 2026-02-19.</strong> Access control policies reviewed twice annually. Review triggers: scheduled cycle, regulatory changes (GDPR, NIS2), significant security incidents, organizational changes, AWS Identity Center updates. Living documentation, not archaeological artifacts.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Semi-annual reviews mean continuous improvement, not compliance theater. AWS evolves. Threats evolve. Access policies must evolve.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. 📊 Audit Logging Everything</h3>
          <p><strong>AWS CloudTrail + Identity Center logs + GitHub audit logs.</strong> Who accessed what, when, from where. Audit trails for every privilege escalation. Logs retained per <a href="discordian-data-classification.html">Data Classification Policy</a>. Logging without alerting is security theater. Logs you don't review are data hoarding, not security.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Audit trails enable incident response. No logs = no investigation. CloudTrail + centralized logging = systematic accountability.</em></p>

    <section id="authentication">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Multi-Factor Authentication: Not Optional, Not Negotiable</h2>
      
      <p><strong>MFA isn't optional.</strong> Passwords alone are security theater. At Hack23, we enforce MFA across all systems with classification-appropriate methods:</p>
      
      <p><strong>🔐 MFA Implementation by System Type:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Root Account:</strong> Hardware MFA (YubiKey) + recovery codes in secure vault. Never used for daily operations (Identity Center SSO instead).</li>
        <li><strong>AWS Identity Center:</strong> Identity provider MFA + SSO. Central authentication point for all AWS accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Organizations:</strong> TOTP required (Authy/Google Authenticator) + SSH keys for git operations. Security keys supported.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Systems:</strong> Provider MFA (Stripe, payment gateways) + hardware/SMS backup. Monthly access reviews.</li>
        <li><strong>Development Tools:</strong> Platform-native MFA (SonarCloud, Snyk, FOSSA). TOTP preferred, SMS acceptable.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing Platforms:</strong> Platform-native MFA. Annual reviews sufficient for public-classified systems.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>The Five Factors of Not Getting Pwned:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Something you know</strong> (password) — Easily stolen, phished, guessed. Never used alone.</li>
        <li><strong>Something you have</strong> (hardware token) — YubiKey for AWS root. Better than SMS, losable but replaceable.</li>
        <li><strong>Something you are</strong> (biometric) — Not used (can't change if compromised, privacy concerns).</li>
        <li><strong>Somewhere you are</strong> (geolocation) — IP addresses lie. Not relied upon for authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Something you do</strong> (behavior patterns) — ML-based, fallible but useful for anomaly detection.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Use at least two factors.</strong> Three is better for critical systems (AWS Identity Center = IdP password + IdP MFA + SSO). One factor is negligence.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: Access Control Is Authority Control</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Except access without identity verification, classification-appropriate MFA, and systematic audit logging—that's not zero trust, that's zero security.</p>
      
      <p>Most organizations claim "zero trust" while running VPN-based perimeter security. They say "MFA required" but allow SMS fallback for everything. They perform annual access reviews when quarterly is minimum. They trust network location instead of identity verification.</p>
      
      <p>We implement zero trust through systematic controls. <strong>AWS Identity Center SSO</strong> for centralized identity management. <strong>100% MFA coverage</strong> with classification-appropriate methods (hardware for critical, TOTP for high, platform native for public). <strong>90-day dormant account reviews</strong> with weekly monitoring and zero-tolerance targets. <strong>Semi-annual policy reviews</strong> (Version 2.2, next review: 2026-02-19). <strong>Classification-driven access matrix</strong> aligning privileges with business impact.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Question "trust but verify" dogma—just verify. Question why password-only access is acceptable—it's not. Question annual access reviews when dormant accounts create risk daily. (Spoiler: Because systematic access control requires operational discipline, not annual compliance theater.)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Our competitive advantage:</strong> We demonstrate cybersecurity consulting expertise through verifiable access control implementation. Public <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md">Access Control Policy</a> with specific metrics. AWS Identity Center architecture documented. MFA enforcement demonstrable. 90-day review cycles automated. This isn't theoretical—it's operational reality clients can audit before engagement.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION: You are now in Chapel Perilous. Access control is authority control. Who gets access defines who has power. Systematic verification prevents unauthorized power. Choose identity-centric security over network-centric hope. Your incident response depends on it.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong></p>
      
      <p>Read our full <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md">Access Control Policy on GitHub</a>. Public. Auditable. Zero bullshit. With specific MFA requirements, session timeouts, review frequencies, and access control matrices clients can verify.</p>
