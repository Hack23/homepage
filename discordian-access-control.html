    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Why "Trust but Verify" Is Half Wrong</h2>
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> The phrase "trust but verify" is security dogma. Here's the truth: <strong>Just verify.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Except access without authentication, authorization, and audit logging.</p>
      <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md">Access Control Policy</a> is public because access control through obscurity is like hiding keys under the doormat.</p>
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Trust is a vulnerability. Verification is a control. Choose controls over vulnerabilities.</em></p>
    </section>
    <section id="zero-trust">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Zero Trust: Not Paranoia, Just Mathematics</h2>
      <p>"Zero trust" sounds paranoid. It's not. It's <strong>acknowledging reality</strong>:</p>
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>1. Verify Every Request</h3>
          <p>No implicit trust. No "you're on the VPN so you're good." <strong>Every access request gets challenged.</strong> Always.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The network perimeter dissolved in 2010. Anyone still trusting it is LARPing security.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>2. Least Privilege Always</h3>
          <p>Minimum access required. Time-limited when possible. <strong>Revoke by default.</strong> Privilege creep is how admins become attackers.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Admin access is like root access to reality. Use sudo, not stay logged in as god.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <h3>3. Assume Breach</h3>
          <p>Design like attackers are already inside. Because they probably are. <strong>Limit blast radius.</strong> Segment. Isolate. Monitor.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: If you can't detect malicious admin activity, you don't have security—you have hope.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>4. Log Everything</h3>
          <p>Who accessed what, when, from where. <strong>Audit trails or it didn't happen.</strong> Logs you don't review are data hoarding, not security.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Logging without alerting is like having security cameras that nobody watches.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>5. Encrypt in Transit</h3>
          <p>Network is hostile. Always. <strong>TLS everything.</strong> VPNs aren't trust—they're encrypted untrust over untrusted networks.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Cleartext on the wire is cleartext in the database after the breach. Plan accordingly.</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="authentication">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Factors of Not Getting Pwned</h2>
      <p><strong>Multi-factor authentication isn't optional.</strong> Passwords alone are security theater. The Law of Fives demands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Something you know</strong> (password) — Easily stolen, phished, guessed</li>
        <li><strong>Something you have</strong> (hardware token) — Better, but losable</li>
        <li><strong>Something you are</strong> (biometric) — Can't change if compromised</li>
        <li><strong>Somewhere you are</strong> (geolocation) — IP addresses lie</li>
        <li><strong>Something you do</strong> (behavior patterns) — ML-based, fallible but useful</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Use at least two factors.</strong> Three is better. One is negligence.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Access Control Is Authority Control</h2>
      <p><strong>Think for yourself. Question authority.</strong> Especially authority to access sensitive data.</p>
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> Chaos teaches: trust enables betrayal. Verification prevents surprises.</p>
      <p>Read our full <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md">Access Control Policy on GitHub</a>. Public. Auditable. Zero bullshit.</p>
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>FINAL ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The most dangerous access is the access you forgot exists. Review permissions. Revoke liberally. Trust nothing.</em></p>
