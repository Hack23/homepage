            <h1>Acceptable Use Policy: Don't Do Stupid Shit on Company Systems</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Except stupid shit on company systems."</em></p>

            <h2>📜 The Problem: Common Sense Isn't Common</h2>
            
            <p>Don't use company systems for illegal activity. Don't install malware. Don't harass colleagues. <strong>This shouldn't need saying. Yet here we are.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Acceptable Use Policies define what you can and can't do on company systems. Most people ignore them until HR gets involved.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Acceptable use policies exist because someone did the unacceptable thing. Every rule is a story. Read the policy and imagine the incidents.
            </div>

            <h2>🚫 The Five Rules Everyone Should Know</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. No Illegal Activity</h3>
                    <p><strong>Obvious but apparently necessary.</strong></p>
                    <p>No piracy, no hacking, no harassment, no fraud. Company systems aren't your personal crime toolkit.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Reasonable Personal Use</h3>
                    <p><strong>Some personal use is fine. Don't abuse it.</strong></p>
                    <p>Checking personal email: fine. Streaming Netflix all day: not fine. Running a side business: definitely not fine.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. No Unauthorized Software</h3>
                    <p><strong>Don't install random shit.</strong></p>
                    <p>Shadow IT creates shadow vulnerabilities. Request approved software. Don't circumvent controls.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Respect Monitoring</h3>
                    <p><strong>Company systems are monitored. No expectation of privacy.</strong></p>
                    <p>Email is logged. Web traffic is monitored. Don't expect privacy on systems you don't own.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Report Violations</h3>
                    <p><strong>See something, say something.</strong></p>
                    <p>Report policy violations. Report suspicious activity. Silence enables abuse.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> Every absurdly specific policy exists because someone did that exact thing. Acceptable use policies are archaeological records of past stupidity.
            </div>

            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            
            <p>Our acceptable use policy is public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Acceptable_Use_Policy.md" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy</a></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Written policy</strong> - Clear, accessible, acknowledged by all employees</li>
                <li><strong>Reasonable personal use</strong> - Limited personal use allowed</li>
                <li><strong>No expectation of privacy</strong> - Systems are monitored for security</li>
                <li><strong>Consequences defined</strong> - Violations result in disciplinary action</li>
                <li><strong>Regular reminders</strong> - Annual acknowledgment required</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Acceptable use policies don't prevent bad behavior—they document acceptable behavior so consequences are defensible. Policy is HR armor.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Don't Be That Person</h2>
            
            <p>Acceptable use policies exist because people do unacceptable things. <strong>Don't be that person.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Use company systems for work. Reasonable personal use is fine. Don't do illegal things. Don't install unauthorized software. Don't expect privacy.</p>
            
            <p>Or be that person and find out why HR has an acceptable use policy.</p>
