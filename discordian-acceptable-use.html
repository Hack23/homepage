Everything is permitted.</strong> Except the stupid shit people keep doing on company systems despite explicit policies, training, and that one email from HR everyone ignored. That's documented, logged, monitored in real-time, and <em>will</em> be used against you when HR needs ammunition. <strong>FNORD.</strong> Your browsing history knows what you did. So does CloudTrail. So does GuardDuty. Act accordingly.<p><em>Think for yourself, schmuck! Question authority.</em> But also question why your colleagues keep installing "totally legitimate" cryptocurrency miners that definitely aren't stealing CPU cycles for someone else's profit. Are YOU paranoid enough to actually read the AUP before violating it? Nobody else is—which is why HR exists. <strong>The policy exists because someone did exactly that stupid thing. You're not the first. You won't be the last.</strong><p>Welcome to Chapel Perilous, psychonaut. At Hack23, our Acceptable Use Policy isn't corporate theater—it's <strong>ISO 27001 A.8.1.3</strong> (Acceptable Use of Assets), <strong>CIS Control 16.8</strong> (Acceptable Use Policy), and <strong>GDPR Art. 5</strong> (Data Processing Principles) compliance weaponized into systematic reality. Every rule exists because someone did that EXACT stupid thing. Every specific prohibition is an archaeological record of past facepalms.<p class=hidden-wisdom><em>ILLUMINATION: Acceptable use policies don't prevent bad behavior—they document it so HR has ammo. The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy. When (not if) you violate the AUP, know that we saw it coming and wrote it down first. You're not special.</em><p>Are you paranoid enough? Our approach combines business purpose primary standards (translation: work, not Netflix) with reasonable personal use allowances (because we're not monsters), annual review cycles (somebody has to read this), and single-person company transparency (yes, I'm watching myself, recursively). The panopticon works best when you internalize the watcher.

Software development, cybersecurity consulting, client delivery, business admin. But we're not sociopaths—reasonable personal use is fine. Check your email. Read the news. Learn stuff. Just don't mine Bitcoin or run your side hustle dropshipping operation. FNORD.<p class=hidden-wisdom><em>Reasonable personal use: email, news, learning. Unacceptable: competing business, excessive cat videos, cryptocurrency mining (yes, we can tell). The panopticon sees all but chooses its battles.</em></div><div class="card integrity-card"><div class=scanner-effect></div><h3>2. 🔐 Security: Not Optional, Not Negotiable</h3><p>All system usage follows security policies. ALL. <a href=discordian-access-control.html>MFA or GTFO</a>. <a href=discordian-crypto.html>Encryption mandatory</a>. <a href=discordian-network-security.html>VPN when remote</a>. <a href=discordian-secure-dev.html>Secure code or code review hell</a>. Are you paranoid enough to follow basic security hygiene? The attackers are.<p class=hidden-wisdom><em>Security controls protect YOU from yourself. That "one time" you skipped MFA? That's when the breach happens. Murphy's Law is a security framework.</em></div><div class="card availability-card"><div class=scanner-effect></div><h3>3. ⚖️ Legal Compliance (Or: How To Avoid Prison)</h3><p><strong>Don't do illegal shit.</strong> GDPR isn't optional. Copyright law applies to you. Computer crime laws will ruin your life. Export controls on crypto are real. Single-person company or enterprise, laws don't care about your org chart. ISO 27001 A.8.1.3 + GDPR Art. 5 = staying out of court.<p class=hidden-wisdom><em>"I didn't know" is not a legal defense. "The bureaucracy made me do it" works even less. Know the law or hire someone who does. We chose option two.</em></div><div class="card confidentiality-card"><div class=scanner-effect></div><h3>4. 🤝 Professional Conduct (Be Less Terrible)</h3><p>Don't harass people. Don't discriminate. Don't be malicious. Don't make us write MORE specific rules. Every absurdly detailed prohibition exists because SOMEONE did that EXACT thing. You're not that someone. Right? RIGHT?<p class=hidden-wisdom><em>Professional conduct = competitive advantage. Clients audit our security culture. Every policy violation is visible in logs. The panopticon is real and it's made of CloudTrail.</em></div><div class="card integrity-card"><div class=scanner-effect></div><h3>5. 🌟 Radical Transparency (Surprise: You're Monitored)</h3><p><strong>No expectation of privacy on company systems.</strong> Everything is logged. Everything is monitored. Annual review (next: 2026-11-05) means living documentation. Public <a href=https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Acceptable_Use_Policy.md>AUP on GitHub</a> because security through obscurity is security through stupidity. CIS Control 16.8 compliance through uncomfortable honesty.<p class=hidden-wisdom><em>Secret AUPs are vulnerabilities. Public policies are accountability. We tell you we're watching.

Everything is permitted.</strong> Except the shit explicitly prohibited in this AUP that you just skimmed because nobody actually READS these things. FNORD. That's the joke—acceptable use policies exist precisely BECAUSE people don't read them, then act shocked when consequences happen.<p>Are you paranoid enough yet? Most orgs write unreadable 50-page legalese AUPs, force acknowledgment checkboxes nobody reads, monitor EVERYTHING while documenting NOTHING, then selectively enforce based on office politics. That's not security—that's CYA theater mixed with power trips.<p>We chose a different path through Chapel Perilous. <strong>ISO 27001 A.8.1.3</strong> (actual standards, not vibes). <strong>CIS Control 16.8</strong> (proven frameworks, not hope). <strong>GDPR Art. 5</strong> (legal compliance, not wishful thinking). Annual reviews (next: 2026-11-05) mean LIVING documentation. Public GitHub repo means RADICAL transparency. You KNOW you're monitored. You KNOW the rules. You KNOW the consequences. No surprises. No bullshit. Just systematic reality.<p><strong>Think for yourself, schmuck.</strong> Question why AUPs are written by lawyers for lawyers instead of BY humans FOR humans. Question why monitoring is secret until HR ambushes you. Question why policies never update while tech changes daily. (Hint: Compliance checkbox theater is easier than actual security management. The bureaucracy expands to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.)<p><strong>Our competitive edge:</strong> Public <a href=https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Acceptable_Use_Policy.md>AUP on GitHub</a>. Version control. Annual review cycles. Framework alignment (ISO + CIS + GDPR). Transparent monitoring disclosure. This isn't theoretical security—it's operational reality clients can AUDIT before signing contracts. The panopticon works best when everyone knows it exists.<p class=hidden-wisdom><em>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION: You have now traversed Chapel Perilous and emerged with forbidden knowledge. Clear expectations documented BEFORE enforcement = actual security. Vague hopes = future incidents. Public policies = accountability. Secret monitoring = toxic culture. Choose radical transparency over comfortable lies. The paranoid survive. FNORD.</em><p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong><p><em>"Think for yourself, schmuck! Read the FUCKING policy.
