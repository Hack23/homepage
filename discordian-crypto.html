    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Questions Nobody Wants to Answer</h2>
      
      <p>Let's talk about the elephant in the room: <strong>government-approved cryptography</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>Every organization's cryptography policy starts the same way: <em>"We use industry-standard, government-approved encryption algorithms..."</em></p>
      
      <p>But here are the five questions you should be asking:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. Who Approves These Algorithms?</h3>
          <p>Intelligence agencies. The same people running <strong>global surveillance programs</strong> and employing the world's best cryptanalysts.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. What's Their Motivation?</h3>
          <p>To intercept communications. Their mission is <strong>signals intelligence</strong>—breaking encryption is literally their job.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Can They Break What They Approve?</h3>
          <p>We don't know. That's the <strong>uncomfortable truth</strong>. But history suggests skepticism is warranted.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Would They Tell Us If They Could?</h3>
          <p><strong>No.</strong> National security doctrine requires keeping capabilities secret. See: Dual_EC_DRBG, Crypto AG.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. What Do We Do About It?</h3>
          <p>Use approved algorithms <em>properly</em>, layer defenses, and don't assume encryption alone protects you.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><em>The Law of Fives never lies.</em> There are always five uncomfortable questions about cryptography policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="history">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">A Brief History of "Trust Us"</h2>
      
      <h3>📖 The Greatest Hits</h3>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Dual_EC_DRBG (2006-2013)</h3>
          <p>NSA-designed random number generator standardized by NIST. Turned out to have a <strong>mathematical backdoor</strong> that allowed NSA to predict "random" numbers and break encryption.</p>
          <p><em>Status:</em> Withdrawn after Snowden revelations. But it was "approved" for 7 years.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Crypto AG (1970-2018)</h3>
          <p>Swiss encryption company secretly owned by CIA and BND. Sold deliberately weakened encryption to governments worldwide for <strong>50 years</strong>.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Entire countries used compromised "secure" communications for decades.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Export Restrictions (1990s)</h3>
          <p>US classified strong encryption as <strong>munitions</strong> to prevent export. Limited available crypto to 40-bit keys—easily breakable even then.</p>
          <p><em>Purpose:</em> Ensure US intelligence could break most global encryption.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Clipper Chip (1993)</h3>
          <p>NSA-designed encryption chip with built-in <strong>law enforcement backdoor</strong>. Abandoned after public outcry—but shows intent.</p>
          <p><em>Lesson:</em> When they can't backdoor standards, they try to backdoor implementations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>NIST Post-Quantum Standards (2024)</h3>
          <p>New quantum-resistant algorithms being standardized. Will quantum computers break current crypto? <strong>NSA says yes</strong>—they're already storing encrypted data for future decryption.</p>
          <p><em>Question:</em> Can we trust the same agencies to approve quantum-resistant standards?</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p>See the pattern? <em>The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="approved-algorithms">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The "Approved" Algorithms List</h2>
      
      <p>Here's what most cryptography policies recommend (including ours). Are they secure? <em>Probably—if implemented correctly.</em> Can nation-states break them? <em>We don't know—and they won't tell us.</em></p>

    <section id="what-we-do">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">What We Actually Do: Our Cryptography Policy</h2>
      
      <p>Given this uncomfortable reality, here's <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Cryptography_Policy.md">our public cryptography policy</a>:</p>
      
      <h3>🎯 Five-Sided Defense Strategy</h3>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. Use Modern Approved Algorithms</h3>
          <p><strong>AES-256, RSA-4096, SHA-256</strong> with proper implementation. Not because we trust them blindly—but because breaking them is <em>computationally expensive</em>.</p>
          <p><em>Rationale:</em> Make surveillance expensive. Force them to use their best capabilities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Prefer Non-NSA Alternatives</h3>
          <p>When available: <strong>ChaCha20, Ed25519, Argon2</strong>. Algorithms not designed by intelligence agencies may be more trustworthy.</p>
          <p><em>Rationale:</em> Diversify cryptographic dependencies.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Implementation Matters More Than Algorithm</h3>
          <p>Perfect crypto with bad implementation = useless. Use <strong>proven libraries</strong> (OpenSSL, libsodium, Go crypto). Don't roll your own.</p>
          <p><em>Rationale:</em> Most breaks are implementation flaws, not algorithmic.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Defense in Depth</h3>
          <p><strong>Never rely on encryption alone.</strong> Layer: encryption + access control + monitoring + key rotation + audit logging.</p>
          <p><em>Rationale:</em> Assume crypto can be broken. Have other controls.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. Transparency + Auditability</h3>
          <p>Public cryptography policy. Open-source tools when possible. <strong>Verify, don't trust.</strong></p>
          <p><em>Rationale:</em> Transparency enables scrutiny—the only real accountability.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="key-management">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Key Management: Where Everything Falls Apart</h2>
      
      <p>Here's the dirty secret: <strong>algorithm choice matters less than key management</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>Perfect encryption is useless if:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Keys are stored in plaintext configuration files</li>
        <li>Keys are never rotated</li>
        <li>Keys are shared insecurely</li>
        <li>Keys are accessible to too many people/systems</li>
        <li>Key generation uses weak random number generators</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This is where organizations fail. Not because NSA backdoored AES—but because they <strong>left the keys in a text file in their S3 bucket</strong>.</p>
      
      <h3>🔑 Our Key Management Principles</h3>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)</h3>
          <p>Use <strong>AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or dedicated HSMs</strong> for key storage. Keys never leave the secure boundary.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Automated Key Rotation</h3>
          <p>Rotate keys regularly: <strong>annually for master keys, quarterly for operational keys</strong>. Limit blast radius of compromise.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Principle of Least Privilege</h3>
          <p>Only systems/people that <strong>absolutely need</strong> key access get it. Use IAM policies, not shared credentials.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Audit Logging</h3>
          <p><strong>Log every key use.</strong> Detect anomalous access patterns. Enable forensics after compromise.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Secure Key Generation</h3>
          <p>Use <strong>cryptographically secure RNGs</strong>. Never use predictable seeds. Test entropy sources.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="threat-model">

          <p><em>Question:</em> Should we trust the new standards more than the old ones? History suggests caution.</p>

          <h3>⏰ Timeline Estimates</h3>
          <p>Cryptographically-relevant quantum computers: <strong>coming eventually</strong> (publicly). Nation-states may have them sooner—or may want you to think they do.</p>
          <p><em>Action:</em> Start planning post-quantum migration now, but don't panic. Yet.</p>
        </div>

      <p><strong>Our Approach:</strong> Monitor NIST post-quantum standards. Test implementations. Prepare for hybrid classical/quantum crypto. But remain <em>appropriately skeptical</em> about "approved" quantum-resistant algorithms, because we've seen this movie before.</p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Bottom Line: Use Crypto, But Don't Be Naive About It</h2>
      
      <p>So what do we do with this uncomfortable knowledge? Do we give up and go live in a cave? No—we act like adults who understand trade-offs:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use approved algorithms properly</strong>—they're genuinely hard to break (just not impossible for well-funded adversaries)</li>
        <li><strong>Prefer non-NSA alternatives when available</strong>—ChaCha20, Ed25519, and other non-intelligence-agency designs when you can</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on implementation and key management</strong>—perfect crypto with terrible key management is useless crypto</li>
        <li><strong>Layer your defenses</strong>—never rely on encryption alone, because it's one tool in a toolbox, not a magic wand</li>
        <li><strong>Assume capable adversaries can compromise your systems</strong>—design for detection and response, not imaginary perfect prevention</li>
        <li><strong>Be transparent about your crypto policy</strong>—publish it, let people audit it, accept the scrutiny</li>
        <li><strong>Remember the Law of Fives</strong>—there are always five ways they can get around your defenses, and these are just the ones you know about</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> The truth is uncomfortable, but it's better than false security sold by vendors who've never been targeted by a nation-state.</p>
