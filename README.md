## Past Projects

One of James's notable projects is the [Citizen Intelligence Agency](https://github.com/Hack23/cia), a volunteer-driven, open-source intelligence (OSINT) project that provides a neutral and comprehensive dashboard focusing on political activity in Sweden. The project relies on open data from various sources such as the Swedish Parliament, the Swedish Election Authority, the World Bank, and the Swedish National Financial Management Authority (ESV).

## Current Projects

James is currently working on [Lambda in Private VPC](https://github.com/Hack23/aws-resilience-hub/tree/main/examples/lambda-in-private-vpc), a proof-of-concept (POC) that showcases a multi-region active/active site leveraging Resilience Hub policy compliance and runbooks.
