    <section id="intro">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Security-by-Design: DevSecOps as Competitive Advantage</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Except shipping code without threat models—that's not agile development, that's gambling with someone else's data and hoping you're lucky. <em>Every line of code is a potential vulnerability. Every feature is a potential attack surface. Every dependency is a potential supply chain compromise. Act accordingly.</em></p>
      
      <p><em>Think for yourself, schmuck! Question authority.</em> Especially the authority that says "security slows us down" (it doesn't—poor quality slows you down, security just makes it visible). Question "move fast and break things" when "things" includes user data and "breaking" means breach. Our security-by-design <em>is</em> our velocity because secure code doesn't require emergency patches at 3am. <strong>Are you paranoid enough to threat model before coding? We are—it's cheaper than incident response.</strong></p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, security isn't bolted on—<strong>it's architected in from commit one</strong>. STRIDE threat modeling before code, 80% test coverage minimum, SLSA 3 build attestations, OpenSSF Scorecard 7.0+ targets. Every repository includes SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md, THREAT_MODEL.md, comprehensive test plans, and automated CI/CD security gates. This isn't overhead—it's systematic operational excellence creating measurable competitive advantages.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ILLUMINATION: Most companies write code first, add security later, ship vulnerabilities always. We threat model first, test continuously, ship evidence publicly.</em></p>
      
      <p>Our approach combines bleeding-edge development velocity (daily dependency updates, auto-merge on green) with enterprise-grade security controls (mandatory threat models, 80% coverage, SLSA attestations). This demonstrates our cybersecurity consulting expertise through living proof—not promises. Full technical implementation in our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Secure_Development_Policy.md">public Secure Development Policy</a>.</p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. 🎯 Mandatory Threat Modeling</h3>
          <p><strong>STRIDE before code.</strong> Every project requires THREAT_MODEL.md with comprehensive analysis: STRIDE framework application, MITRE ATT&amp;CK integration, attack tree development, quantitative risk assessment. CIA scored OpenSSF 7.2—public threat models are proof of systematic security thinking, not checkbox compliance.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Code without threat models is just vulnerability creation with optimism and a budget.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. 📊 80% Test Coverage Minimum</h3>
          <p>Comprehensive testing isn't optional. <strong>Minimum 80% line coverage, 70% branch coverage.</strong> Public JaCoCo/Jest/Vitest reports, automated execution on every commit, historical trend tracking. CIA and Black Trigram maintain live coverage dashboards—transparency over promises, evidence over claims.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>If you can't measure it, you can't secure it. If you won't publish it, you're hiding something.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. 🔐 SLSA 3 Build Attestations</h3>
          <p>Supply chain security through verifiable provenance. SLSA 3 attestations, signed artifacts, automated SBOM generation, immutable build evidence. Every release includes cryptographic proof of what was built, by whom, from what source. Trust but verify—we provide the verification data.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Unsigned artifacts are promises. Signed attestations are proof. We deal in proof.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. 🏗️ Security Architecture Documentation</h3>
          <p>Living documentation, not stale PDFs. Every repository: SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md (current state), FUTURE_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md (roadmap), WORKFLOWS.md (CI/CD automation). Mermaid diagrams, evidence links, AWS Well-Architected alignment. Documentation as code means it stays current or CI fails.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation. Automated verification beats manual promises.</em></p>
        </div>

          <p>Humans make mistakes at 2am. Computers don't. SAST (SonarCloud), SCA (Dependabot/FOSSA), DAST (OWASP ZAP), secret scanning, CodeQL—all automated, all blocking on critical findings. OpenSSF Scorecard 7.0+ targets with public badges. Security gates aren't bureaucracy—they're systematic excellence at scale.</p>

      <p>Secure development at Hack23 isn't checkbox compliance—it's <strong>systematic operational excellence creating measurable competitive advantages</strong>. STRIDE threat modeling before code. 80% test coverage minimum. SLSA 3 attestations. OpenSSF 7.0+ targets. Public security architecture documentation. Automated CI/CD gates blocking critical findings.</p>
      
      <p><strong>This isn't security slowing us down—it's security enabling velocity.</strong> Daily dependency updates because we trust our test suites. Auto-merge on green because we trust our security gates. Bleeding-edge releases because we have comprehensive safety controls.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Don't blindly trust frameworks, libraries, or "industry best practices." Our OpenSSF 7.2 score isn't bragging—it's evidence of systematic implementation. Our public threat models aren't marketing—they're proof we thought it through.</p>
