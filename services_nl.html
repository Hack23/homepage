Hourly consulting provides flexibility for exploratory work, ongoing advisory services, or projects with evolving requirements. For longer engagements, we also offer monthly retainer arrangements that provide predictable costs and priority access to beveiliging expertise. We discuss your specific needs and budget constraints during initial consultations to recommend the most appropriate engagement model.

We work remotely or on-site in Gothenburg, adapting to your team's working style and existing tools.

We begin with discovery sessions to understand business context, technical architecture, and current beveiliging posture.

We then create detailed documentation including C4 architecture diagrams, MITRE ATT&CK technique mappings, and prioritized beveiliging recommendations. Finally, we provide implementation guidance with beveiliging control roadmap, cost-benefit analysis, and integration with existing systemen. The entire process emphasizes practical, actionable insights that align beveiliging investments with business priorities. All reviews are based on proven frameworks like the one documented in our public beveiliging architecture examples."

We routinely sign mutual NDAs before engagement discussions begin and maintain strict confidentiality for all client information, architectures, and vulnerabilities. Our beveiliging practices include secure document handling with encrypted storage and transmission, limited access to client data on need-to-know basis, and secure communication channels for sensitive discussions. We follow our documented Data Protection and Privacy policies, which are publicly available in our ISMS repository. Despite our commitment to transparency in our own beveiliging practices, we fully respect and protect client confidentiality. All findings and recommendations remain confidential unless clients choose to share them publicly."

            "text": "Our naleving approach focuses on practical implementation rather than checkbox exercises. We start by understanding your business context and regulatory requirements (ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, SOC 2, PCI DSS). Then we perform gap analysis against applicable frameworks, identifying both naleving gaps and opportunities for beveiliging improvement. Our implementation methodology includes developing tailored beveiliging policies and procedures, establishing risk management processes, creating evidence collection and documentation systemen, and preparing for external audits. We emphasize building sustainable naleving programs that integrate with existing business processes rather than creating parallel bureaucracy. Throughout the engagement, we provide education and knowledge transfer to ensure your team can maintain naleving independently. Our public ISMS repository demonstrates our comprehensive understanding of naleving frameworks and real-world implementation."

Monthly beveiliging advisory retainers provide regular strategic guidance, beveiliging roadmap reviews, and priority access for urgent questions. Incident response ondersteuning includes on-call availability for beveiliging incidents and breach response coordination. Virtual CISO services offer part-time strategic beveiliging leadership for organizations without full-time beveiliging executives. Continuous architecture reviews help evaluate new technologies and services from a beveiliging perspective. Security program maturity assessment tracks improvement over time against industry benchmarks. All ongoing ondersteuning engagements include regular check-ins, quarterly reports, and knowledge transfer to build internal capabilities. We adapt ondersteuning models to match your organization's maturity level and budget, scaling services as your beveiliging program evolves."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "We measure beveiliging improvements using multiple quantifiable metrics aligned with industry frameworks. Risk reduction metrics include quantified risk scores before and after implementation, reduction in high and critical vulnerabilities, and mean time to detect and respond to beveiliging incidents. Compliance metrics track control implementation status against ISO 27001, NIST, or CIS benchmarks, audit finding closure rates, and beveiliging policy naleving percentages. Technical metrics include beveiliging tool coverage (SAST, DAST, SCA), percentage of assets with current beveiliging patches, and automated beveiliging testing in CI/CD pipelines. We also measure beveiliging maturity progression using NIST Cyberbeveiliging Framework levels or similar models. All measurements are documented in regular progress reports with clear visualizations and trend analysis. Our approach follows the Security Metrics framework documented in our public ISMS, ensuring transparent and meaningful measurement of beveiliging investments."

						<div class="faq-answer">
							<p>Security engagement duration varies based on scope and objectives. Quick beveiliging assessments typically take 2-4 weeks, covering high-level risk identification and priority recommendations. Comprehensive beveiliging architecture reviews require 4-8 weeks for in-depth analysis and detailed implementation plans. ISO 27001 or ISMS implementation projects span 3-6 months, including policy development, risk assessment, and auditvoorbereiding. Cloud beveiliging transformations range from 2-4 months for architecture design and DevSecOps integration. Ongoing beveiliging advisory services can be structured as monthly retainers with flexible engagement models. We work with your team to define realistic timelines that balance thoroughness with business urgency.</p>

							<h3>Hoe gaat u om met NDA's en vertrouwelijkheid?</h3>
						</summary>
						<div class="faq-answer">
							<p>We handle client confidentiality with the utmost seriousness and professionalism. We routinely sign mutual NDAs before engagement discussions begin and maintain strict confidentiality for all client information, architectures, and vulnerabilities. Our beveiliging practices include secure document handling with encrypted storage and transmission, limited access to client data on need-to-know basis, and secure communication channels for sensitive discussions. We follow our documented Data Protection and Privacy policies, which are publicly available in our ISMS repository. Despite our commitment to transparency in our own beveiliging practices, we fully respect and protect client confidentiality. All findings and recommendations remain confidential unless clients choose to share them publicly.</p>

							<h3>What is your approach to naleving projects?</h3>
						</summary>
						<div class="faq-answer">
							<p>Our naleving approach focuses on practical implementation rather than checkbox exercises. We emphasize building sustainable naleving programs that integrate with existing business processes, not parallel bureaucracy.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>We start by understanding your business context and regulatory requirements (ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, SOC 2, PCI DSS).</li>
								<li>We perform gap analysis against applicable frameworks, identifying both naleving gaps and opportunities for beveiliging improvement.</li>
								<li>Our implementation methodology includes:
									<ul>
										<li>Developing tailored beveiliging policies and procedures</li>
										<li>Establishing risk management processes</li>
										<li>Creating evidence collection and documentation systemen</li>

							<p>We measure beveiliging improvements using multiple quantifiable metrics aligned with industry frameworks. Key measurement areas include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Risk reduction:</strong> Quantified risk scores before and after implementation, reduction in high and critical vulnerabilities, and mean time to detect and respond to beveiliging incidents.</li>
								<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Control implementation status against ISO 27001, NIST, or CIS benchmarks, audit finding closure rates, and beveiliging policy naleving percentages.</li>
								<li><strong>Technical metrics:</strong> Security tool coverage (SAST, DAST, SCA), percentage of assets with current beveiliging patches, and automated beveiliging testing in CI/CD pipelines.</li>
								<li><strong>Security maturity:</strong> Progression using NIST Cyberbeveiliging Framework levels or similar models.</li>
								<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> All measurements are documented in regular progress reports with clear visualizations and trend analysis.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Our approach follows the Security Metrics framework documented in our public ISMS, ensuring transparent and meaningful measurement of beveiliging investments.</p>
