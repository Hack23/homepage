    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Stop Buying Fear, Start Thinking</h2>
      
      <p>The security industry is a protection racket with better PR. <em>"Cybercriminals are everywhere!" "Your data is at risk!" "Buy this solution—or suffer the consequences!"</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including the permission vendors give themselves to manufacture fear and sell you the cure.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Security investments should deliver <em>actual value</em>—not just fund the security-industrial complex's quarterly earnings.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: If your security strategy is based on fear rather than risk assessment, congratulations—you're the product, not the customer.</em></p>

      <h3>The Six Value Dimensions (Because Everything Comes in Fives, Plus One)</h3>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🤝 Trust Enhancement</h3>
          <p>Customers and partners actually trust you with their data. Wild concept, right? When people know you take security seriously (and can verify it), they're more willing to give you money.</p>
          <p><strong>Real Impact:</strong> Higher customer retention, easier sales cycles, premium pricing power.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Hidden Wisdom: Trust is expensive to build and cheap to destroy. One breach undoes years of security theater.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>⚙️ Operational Efficiency</h3>
          <p>Reliable systems that don't wake you up at 3am. Secure systems tend to be <em>stable</em> systems because you actually thought about how they work.</p>
          <p><strong>Real Impact:</strong> Less downtime, fewer incidents, team spends time building instead of firefighting.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Hidden Wisdom: If your security makes operations harder, you're doing security wrong.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>💡 Innovation Enablement</h3>
          <p>Security that lets you do new things instead of blocking them. Good security <em>enables</em> innovation by reducing the risk that your new feature becomes a new attack vector.</p>
          <p><strong>Real Impact:</strong> Faster time-to-market, ability to enter regulated markets, partnership opportunities.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Hidden Wisdom: Security that says "no" to everything is just bureaucracy with a fancier title.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>📊 Decision Quality</h3>
          <p>Better business decisions through data you can actually trust. Security includes <em>integrity</em>—knowing your data hasn't been tampered with, corrupted, or just plain wrong.</p>
          <p><strong>Real Impact:</strong> Accurate reporting, confident strategic decisions, fewer expensive mistakes based on garbage data.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Hidden Wisdom: Garbage in, garbage out—unless you also secure the pipe. Then it's just regular garbage.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🏆 Competitive Advantage</h3>
          <p>Market differentiation through security capabilities. In some markets, demonstrable security is a <em>selling point</em>—not just a checkbox.</p>
          <p><strong>Real Impact:</strong> Win deals against competitors, enter regulated markets, command premium positioning.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Hidden Wisdom: Competitive advantage from security only works if your competitors are incompetent. Fortunately, they often are.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🛡️ Risk Reduction</h3>
          <p>Reduced likelihood of business-ending disasters. This is the <em>obvious</em> benefit that everyone leads with—fewer "oh shit" moments.</p>
          <p><strong>Real Impact:</strong> Lower breach costs, reduced downtime, fewer regulatory penalties, better sleep.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Hidden Wisdom: Risk reduction is valuable, but zero risk is impossible. Anyone promising zero risk is selling snake oil.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Transparency Multiplier</h2>
      
      <p>Here's where it gets interesting: <strong>public ISMS documentation</strong> adds an additional ROI multiplier.</p>
      
      <p>When you make your security practices transparent through a <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">Public ISMS</a>, you get:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🎯 Enhanced Trust (substantial improvement)</h3>
          <p><strong>Don't trust us—verify us.</strong> Public documentation enables customer due diligence without sales calls or NDAs.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Shorter sales cycles, higher conversion rates, premium pricing.</p>

          <p>When auditors and customers can <em>see</em> your policies and procedures, compliance becomes a documentation exercise—not an investigation.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Faster certifications, reduced audit costs, easier compliance.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Total Transparency ROI Multiplier: substantial improvement</strong></p>
