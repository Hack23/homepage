      <p>The security industry loves selling fear. <em>"Cybercriminals are coming for you!" "Average breach cost: $4.5 million!" "You need this $500K solution—or else!"</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Enough.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Security investments should deliver <strong>measurable positive returns</strong>—not just reduce imaginary risks. Let's talk about the <em>real</em> business value of security programs, backed by quantifiable metrics.</p>
      
      <p>This isn't security theater. This is <strong>security economics</strong>.</p>

      <p>Here's where it gets interesting: <strong>public ISMS documentation</strong> adds an additional ROI multiplier.</p>

        <div class="card integrity-card">

          <h3>🎯 Enhanced Trust (+20%)</h3>
          <p><strong>Don't trust us—verify us.</strong> Public documentation enables customer due diligence without sales calls or NDAs.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Shorter sales cycles, higher conversion rates, premium pricing.</p>

        <div class="card availability-card">

          <p>Almost nobody does this. Stand out by being <em>radically honest</em> about your security practices.</p>

        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🚀 Compliance Efficiency (+30%)</h3>
          <p>When auditors and customers can <em>see</em> your policies and procedures, compliance becomes a documentation exercise—not an investigation.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Faster certifications, reduced audit costs, easier compliance.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Total Transparency ROI Multiplier: +65%</strong></p>
      
      <p>This means a moderate security program with transparent documentation can achieve <strong>165-265% ROI</strong> instead of 100-200%.</p>
