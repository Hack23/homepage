    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Castle-and-Moat Security Died With Mobile Devices</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Network security used to be simple: hard shell, soft interior. Firewall keeps bad guys out, everything inside is trusted.</p>
      
      <p><strong>That model is dead.</strong> Has been for years. But consultants keep selling it because it's easy to explain to executives who don't understand technology.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including attackers already inside your "secure" network. Plan for it.</p>
      
      <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Network_Security_Policy.md">Network Security Policy</a> is public because network security through obscurity assumes attackers can't run port scans.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: If your security model assumes attackers are outside, your security model is from 1995. Update it or get pwned.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Why the Network Perimeter Is Fantasy</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Question authority</strong> that still talks about "inside" and "outside" networks:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. Mobile Devices Roam</h3>
          <p>Laptop leaves the office? It's "outside." Comes back? It's "inside" again. <strong>With whatever malware it picked up.</strong> VPN doesn't make devices trustworthy—it just encrypts their attacks.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Every device that crosses the perimeter is a potential Trojan horse. The Greeks taught this lesson 3000 years ago.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Cloud Services Are "Outside"</h3>
          <p>Office 365? AWS? GitHub? <strong>All outside your perimeter.</strong> Yet essential to business. The perimeter doesn't include what you actually use.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Defending a perimeter that doesn't include your data is LARPing security.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Insider Threats Exist</h3>
          <p>Malicious insiders. Compromised accounts. Social engineering. <strong>Threat is already inside.</strong> Your firewall doesn't stop Susan in accounting from clicking phishing links.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The call is coming from inside the house. It always was.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Supply Chain Compromises</h3>
          <p>Trusted vendor gets hacked. Pushes malicious update. <strong>Through your firewall.</strong> Because you trust signed updates from "inside" the perimeter. SolarWinds, anyone?</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Trust is how supply chain attacks work. Zero trust is how they get detected.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. APTs Are Patient</h3>
          <p>Advanced Persistent Threats don't bang on your firewall. They <strong>live inside for months</strong>. Quietly. The perimeter didn't save you—you're already compromised and don't know it.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The average dwell time for breaches is measured in months. Your perimeter failed months ago.</em></p>

    <section id="zero-trust-network">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Zero Trust: Verify Everything, Trust Nothing</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Zero trust networking</strong> isn't paranoia. It's accepting reality and designing accordingly:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Authenticate every request</strong> — Location on network doesn't grant trust. Verify identity, device health, context every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Authorize least privilege</strong> — Just because you're authenticated doesn't mean you get access to everything. Minimum required, time-limited when possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypt everything in transit</strong> — Internal network isn't trusted. TLS everywhere. mTLS for service-to-service.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsegment the network</strong> — Lateral movement is how breaches spread. Segment. Isolate. Contain blast radius.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor all traffic</strong> — Log everything. Alert on anomalies. Assume breach means detecting it fast, not preventing it perfectly.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> Chaos teaches: trust enables betrayal. Verification prevents surprises.</p>

    <section id="firewall-reality">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Firewalls: Necessary But Insufficient</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Firewalls aren't useless.</strong> They're just not sufficient:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>✅ Firewalls Block Port Scans</h3>
          <p>Deny-by-default is good. Reducing attack surface is good. Basic perimeter defense is <em>necessary</em>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>❌ Firewalls Don't Stop Malware</h3>
          <p>Malware uses allowed ports (80/443). Encrypted in TLS. Your firewall sees encrypted traffic and says "looks fine to me."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>✅ Firewalls Provide Defense in Depth</h3>
          <p>Layer in a security stack. One control among many. <strong>Not</strong> the only control.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>❌ Firewalls Create False Confidence</h3>
          <p>"We have a firewall, we're secure!" No. You have <em>one</em> control. You need twenty more.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Firewalls are tools, not magic force fields. Use them. Don't worship them.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="segmentation">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Network Segmentation: Limit the Blast Radius</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Assume breach.</strong> Design so that when (not if) attackers get in, they can't move laterally:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VLANs for different functions</strong> — Development, staging, production in different network segments</li>
        <li><strong>Firewall rules between segments</strong> — Default deny. Explicit allow only what's needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Jump boxes for admin access</strong> — No direct SSH/RDP to production. Through a logged, monitored, hardened jump host.</li>
        <li><strong>Service mesh for microservices</strong> — mTLS between services. Network policy enforcement at pod level.</li>
        <li><strong>Database in separate subnet</strong> — Application tier can reach it. Nothing else can. Principle of least privilege at network layer.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>Flat networks are how one compromised WordPress blog becomes a full domain admin compromise. Segment or suffer.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="monitoring">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Network Monitoring: Seeing the Invisible</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Can't defend what you can't see.</strong> Network monitoring isn't optional:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flow logs</strong> — Who's talking to who, when, how much. Baseline normal, alert on anomalies.</li>
        <li><strong>IDS/IPS</strong> — Intrusion detection. Not prevention (that's usually brittle), but detection and alerting.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS monitoring</strong> — Exfiltration often uses DNS tunneling. Monitor queries for anomalies.</li>
        <li><strong>TLS inspection (carefully)</strong> — Decrypt at perimeter, inspect, re-encrypt. Privacy implications, but blind spots kill.</li>
        <li><strong>SIEM integration</strong> — Network logs into security monitoring. Correlate with other signals.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Question authority:</strong> If your network team says "we can't monitor that," ask why. Usually it's "we don't want to" not "we can't."</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Network Security Is About Containment, Not Prevention</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true.</strong> The perimeter isn't real. "Inside" isn't trusted. Firewalls aren't magic.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Everything is permitted.</strong> Including designing networks that assume breach and minimize damage.</p>

      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>FINAL ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The security-industrial complex sells firewalls and perimeter defense because they're easy to sell. "Buy this box, you're secure!" Reality: Network security is architecture, monitoring, and accepting that perfect prevention is impossible. Design for containment. Plan for detection. Respond with speed.</em></p>
