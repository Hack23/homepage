    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Castle-and-Moat Security Died With Mobile Devices</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself, schmuck!</strong> Network security used to be simple: hard shell, soft interior. Firewall keeps bad guys out, everything inside is trusted. <em>That was always fantasy, but it was comfortable fantasy executives could understand and budget for.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>That model is dead.</strong> Has been dead since mobile devices, cloud services, and remote work murdered it. But consultants keep selling castle-and-moat security because it's easy to explain to executives who don't understand technology—and because admitting the perimeter is fiction means admitting they sold you expensive lies for decades. <strong>FNORD—your firewall is security theater pretending to be protection. The attacks are coming from inside the house. They always were.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including attackers already inside your "secure" network reading this while sipping coffee from their compromised endpoint. Plan for breach. Design for containment. Test your detection. <strong>Are you paranoid enough to assume you're already compromised? You should be. Statistically, you probably are.</strong></p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, we practice what we preach: <strong>zero-trust AWS cloud-native architecture</strong> with defense-in-depth. CloudFront+WAF for perimeter (DDoS protection, OWASP rule sets). GuardDuty for threat intelligence. Security Hub for finding aggregation. VPC Flow Logs for traffic analysis. Multi-region deployment (eu-west-1, eu-central-1) for resilience. DNSSEC verification on all domains. TLS 1.2+ enforced everywhere.</p>
      
      <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Network_Security_Policy.md">Network Security Policy</a> is public because network security through obscurity assumes attackers can't run port scans. Transparency demonstrates our cybersecurity consulting expertise through measurable implementation. <strong>Our threat model assumes you're reading this. Welcome, adversary. Enjoy the documentation.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: If your security model assumes attackers are outside, your security model is from 1995. Update it or get pwned. We updated ours—here's the evidence. <strong>FNORD—the only thing separating you from breach is whether the attacker has coffee yet.</strong></em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Why the Network Perimeter Is Fantasy</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Question authority</strong> that still talks about "inside" and "outside" networks:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. Mobile Devices Roam</h3>
          <p>Laptop leaves the office? It's "outside." Comes back? It's "inside" again. <strong>With whatever malware it picked up.</strong> VPN doesn't make devices trustworthy—it just encrypts their attacks.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Every device that crosses the perimeter is a potential Trojan horse. The Greeks taught this lesson 3000 years ago.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Cloud Services Are "Outside"</h3>
          <p>Office 365? AWS? GitHub? <strong>All outside your perimeter.</strong> Yet essential to business. The perimeter doesn't include what you actually use.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Defending a perimeter that doesn't include your data is LARPing security.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Insider Threats Exist</h3>
          <p>Malicious insiders. Compromised accounts. Social engineering. <strong>Threat is already inside.</strong> Your firewall doesn't stop Susan in accounting from clicking phishing links.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The call is coming from inside the house. It always was.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Supply Chain Compromises</h3>
          <p>Trusted vendor gets hacked. Pushes malicious update. <strong>Through your firewall.</strong> Because you trust signed updates from "inside" the perimeter. SolarWinds, anyone?</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Trust is how supply chain attacks work. Zero trust is how they get detected.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. APTs Are Patient</h3>
          <p>Advanced Persistent Threats don't bang on your firewall. They <strong>live inside for months</strong>. Quietly. The perimeter didn't save you—you're already compromised and don't know it.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The average dwell time for breaches is measured in months. Your perimeter failed months ago.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Zero Trust: Verify Everything, Trust Nothing</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Zero trust networking</strong> isn't paranoia. It's accepting reality and designing accordingly. At Hack23, zero-trust means cloud-native AWS architecture with layered defense:</p>

        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🌐 Perimeter Layer: CloudFront + WAF</h3>
          <p><strong>DDoS Protection:</strong> AWS Shield Standard, CloudFront distribution caching, automatic mitigation</p>
          <p><strong>WAF Rules:</strong> OWASP Top 10 protection, rate limiting, geo-blocking where appropriate</p>
          <p><strong>TLS Enforcement:</strong> TLS 1.2+ mandatory, <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=hack23.com">SSL Labs A+ rating</a></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Evidence: CloudFront metrics show real-time attack mitigation. WAF logs available via CloudWatch.</em></p>

          <h3>🛡️ Application Layer: Private Subnets</h3>
          <p><strong>Lambda Functions:</strong> Serverless compute in private VPC, no direct internet exposure</p>
          <p><strong>API Gateway:</strong> Rate limiting, authentication, request validation before reaching backend</p>
          <p><strong>VPC Endpoints:</strong> Private connectivity to AWS services (S3, KMS, Systems Manager) without NAT</p>

          <h3>💾 Data Layer: Isolated Tier</h3>
          <p><strong>RDS PostgreSQL:</strong> Private subnets only, no public access, encrypted at rest (KMS)</p>
          <p><strong>S3 Buckets:</strong> VPC endpoints for internal access, public access blocked by default</p>

          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🔧 Management Plane: Secure Access</h3>
          <p><strong>Systems Manager:</strong> Secure remote access without SSH/RDP, session logging to CloudTrail</p>
          <p><strong>CloudTrail:</strong> All API calls logged, immutable audit trail, SIEM integration ready</p>
          <p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication:</strong> AWS Identity Center with MFA mandatory for all access</p>

      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Multi-Region Resilience:</strong> Primary region eu-west-1 (Stockholm), failover to eu-central-1 (Frankfurt). AWS Backup cross-region replication. Route 53 health checks with automatic failover.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Authenticate every request</strong> — Location on network doesn't grant trust. Verify identity, device health, context every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Authorize least privilege</strong> — Just because you're authenticated doesn't mean you get access to everything. Minimum required, time-limited when possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypt everything in transit</strong> — TLS 1.2+ everywhere. mTLS for service-to-service communication where applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsegment the network</strong> — Lateral movement is how breaches spread. Private subnets, security groups, VPC endpoints contain blast radius.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor all traffic</strong> — VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty threat detection, Security Hub aggregation. Assume breach means detecting it fast.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> Chaos teaches: trust enables betrayal. Verification prevents surprises. Our network security demonstrates this through public evidence.</p>

          <h3>❌ Firewalls Don't Stop Malware</h3>

    <section id="segmentation">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Network Segmentation: Limit the Blast Radius</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Assume breach.</strong> Design so that when (not if) attackers get in, they can't move laterally:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VLANs for different functions</strong> — Development, staging, production in different network segments</li>
        <li><strong>Firewall rules between segments</strong> — Default deny. Explicit allow only what's needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Jump boxes for admin access</strong> — No direct SSH/RDP to production. Through a logged, monitored, hardened jump host.</li>
        <li><strong>Service mesh for microservices</strong> — mTLS between services. Network policy enforcement at pod level.</li>
        <li><strong>Database in separate subnet</strong> — Application tier can reach it. Nothing else can. Principle of least privilege at network layer.</li>

      <p>Read our full <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Network_Security_Policy.md">Network Security Policy on GitHub</a>. Zero trust. Segmented. Monitored. With public evidence demonstrating implementation. <strong>We're paranoid. You should be too.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>FINAL ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The security-industrial complex sells firewalls and perimeter defense because they're easy to sell. "Buy this box, you're secure!" Reality: Network security is architecture, monitoring, and accepting that perfect prevention is impossible. Design for containment. Plan for detection. Respond with speed. Our AWS cloud-native architecture does exactly this—with measurable proof. <strong>FNORD—we're protecting against attackers who've already read this. Are you?</strong></em></p>
