Firewall keeps bad guys out, everything inside is trusted. <em>That was always fantasy, but it was comfortable fantasy executives could understand and budget for.</em><p><strong>That model is dead.</strong> Has been dead since mobile devices, cloud services, and remote work murdered it. But consultants keep selling castle-and-moat security because it's easy to explain to executives who don't understand technology—and because admitting the perimeter is fiction means admitting they sold you expensive lies for decades. <strong>FNORD—your firewall is security theater pretending to be protection. The attacks are coming from inside the house. They always were.</strong><p><strong>진실은 없다. 모든 것이 허용된다.</strong> Including attackers already inside your "secure" network reading this while sipping coffee from their compromised endpoint. Plan for breach. Design for containment. Test your detection. <strong>Are you paranoid enough to assume you're already compromised? You should be. Statistically, you probably are.</strong><p>At Hack23, we practice what we preach: <strong>zero-trust AWS cloud-native architecture</strong> with defense-in-depth. CloudFront+WAF for perimeter (DDoS protection, OWASP rule sets). GuardDuty for threat intelligence. Security Hub for finding aggregation. VPC Flow Logs for traffic analysis. Multi-region deployment (eu-west-1, eu-central-1) for resilience. DNSSEC verification on all domains. TLS 1.2+ enforced everywhere.<p>Our <a href=https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Network_Security_Policy.md>Network 보안 정책</a> is public because network security through obscurity assumes attackers can't run port scans. Transparency demonstrates our cybersecurity consulting expertise through measurable implementation. <strong>Our threat model assumes you're reading this. Welcome, adversary. Enjoy the documentation.</strong><p class=hidden-wisdom><em>Illumination: If your security model assumes attackers are outside, your security model is from 1995. Update it or get pwned.
