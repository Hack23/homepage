Quick security assessments typically take 2-4 weeks, covering high-level risk identification and priority recommendations. Comprehensive security architecture reviews require 4-8 weeks for in-depth analysis and detailed implementation plans. ISO 27001 or ISMS implementation projects span 3-6 months, including policy development, risk assessment, and audit preparation.

Fixed-price engagements work best for well-defined projects like security assessments, architecture reviews, or compliance implementations with clear scope and deliverables. Hourly consulting provides flexibility for exploratory work, ongoing advisory services, or projects with evolving requirements. For longer engagements, we also offer monthly retainer arrangements that provide predictable costs and priority access to security expertise. We discuss your specific needs and budget constraints during initial consultations to recommend the most appropriate engagement model. Contact us via LinkedIn to discuss pricing tailored to your requirements."

We begin with discovery sessions to understand business context, technical architecture, and current security posture. Next, we perform comprehensive analysis using threat modeling (STRIDE methodology), risk assessment with quantified business impact, and compliance gap analysis against relevant frameworks. We then create detailed documentation including C4 architecture diagrams, MITRE ATT&CK technique mappings, and prioritized security recommendations. Finally, we provide implementation guidance with security control roadmap, cost-benefit analysis, and integration with existing systems. The entire process emphasizes practical, actionable insights that align security investments with business priorities. All reviews are based on proven frameworks like the one documented in our public security architecture examples."

We routinely sign mutual NDAs before engagement discussions begin and maintain strict confidentiality for all client information, architectures, and vulnerabilities. Our security practices include secure document handling with encrypted storage and transmission, limited access to client data on need-to-know basis, and secure communication channels for sensitive discussions. We follow our documented Data Protection and Privacy policies, which are publicly available in our ISMS repository. Despite our commitment to transparency in our own security practices, we fully respect and protect client confidentiality. All findings and recommendations remain confidential unless clients choose to share them publicly."

We start by understanding your business context and regulatory requirements (ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, SOC 2, PCI DSS). Then we perform gap analysis against applicable frameworks, identifying both compliance gaps and opportunities for security improvement. Our implementation methodology includes developing tailored security policies and procedures, establishing risk management processes, creating evidence collection and documentation systems, and preparing for external audits. We emphasize building sustainable compliance programs that integrate with existing business processes rather than creating parallel bureaucracy. Throughout the engagement, we provide education and knowledge transfer to ensure your team can maintain compliance independently. Our public ISMS repository demonstrates our comprehensive understanding of compliance frameworks and real-world implementation."

Monthly security advisory retainers provide regular strategic guidance, security roadmap reviews, and priority access for urgent questions. Incident response support includes on-call availability for security incidents and breach response coordination. Virtual CISO services offer part-time strategic security leadership for organizations without full-time security executives. Continuous architecture reviews help evaluate new technologies and services from a security perspective. Security program maturity assessment tracks improvement over time against industry benchmarks. All ongoing support engagements include regular check-ins, quarterly reports, and knowledge transfer to build internal capabilities. We adapt support models to match your organization's maturity level and budget, scaling services as your security program evolves."

	            "@type": "Answer",
	            "text": "We measure security improvements using multiple quantifiable metrics aligned with industry frameworks. Risk reduction metrics include quantified risk scores before and after implementation, reduction in high and critical vulnerabilities, and mean time to detect and respond to security incidents. Compliance metrics track control implementation status against ISO 27001, NIST, or CIS benchmarks, audit finding closure rates, and security policy compliance percentages. Technical metrics include security tool coverage (SAST, DAST, SCA), percentage of assets with current security patches, and automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines. We also measure security maturity progression using NIST Cybersecurity Framework levels or similar models. All measurements are documented in regular progress reports with clear visualizations and trend analysis. Our approach follows the Security Metrics framework documented in our public ISMS, ensuring transparent and meaningful measurement of security investments."

							<h3>Comment choisir un consultant en cybersécurité ?</h3>
						</summary>
						<div class="faq-answer">
							<p>Choose a cybersecurity consultant based on relevant certifications (CISSP, CISM, AWS Security Specialty), proven experience with similar organizations, transparent methodology with documented processes, industry-specific expertise, and a collaborative approach that integrates security without hindering innovation. Look for consultants who offer public evidence of their security practices, such as open ISMS documentation, reference implementations, and transparent security architectures. At Hack23, we demonstrate our expertise through our public ISMS repository and real-world security implementations across multiple projects.</p>

							<p>We measure security improvements using multiple quantifiable metrics aligned with industry frameworks. Key measurement areas include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Risk reduction:</strong> Quantified risk scores before and after implementation, reduction in high and critical vulnerabilities, and mean time to detect and respond to security incidents.</li>
								<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Control implementation status against ISO 27001, NIST, or CIS benchmarks, audit finding closure rates, and security policy compliance percentages.</li>
								<li><strong>Technical metrics:</strong> Security tool coverage (SAST, DAST, SCA), percentage of assets with current security patches, and automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines.</li>
								<li><strong>Security maturity:</strong> Progression using NIST Cybersecurity Framework levels or similar models.</li>
								<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> All measurements are documented in regular progress reports with clear visualizations and trend analysis.</li>
							</ul>
