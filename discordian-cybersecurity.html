    <h1 class="header">🍎 The Golden Apple of Cybersecurity: Why No Crypto Is Truly Secure</h1>

    <section id="manifesto-intro">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five-Sided Truth They Don't Want You to Know</h2>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> Welcome to the only honest cybersecurity blog you'll read today. While everyone else is selling you on "military-grade encryption" and "government-approved standards," we're here to tell you the truth: <em>if your government approved it, your government can break it.</em></p>
      
      <p>This isn't conspiracy theory—it's <strong>capability theory</strong>. Nation-states possess full-spectrum cyber capabilities including:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. SIGINT & Mass Surveillance</h3>
          <p>They intercept everything. <em>Everything.</em> Your encrypted traffic? Already stored in a data center somewhere, waiting for quantum computers to crack it retrospectively.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Cryptographic Backdoors</h3>
          <p>Why would intelligence agencies allow truly unbreakable encryption to become standard? Every "approved" algorithm has been vetted by people whose job is to <em>break things.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Supply Chain Compromise</h3>
          <p>Hardware backdoors. Firmware implants. Pre-compromised certificates. If they can't break the math, they'll break the implementation—or just buy the company.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Legal Compulsion</h3>
          <p>National Security Letters. FISA Courts. Gag orders. Tech companies can be legally forced to compromise their systems and forbidden from telling you.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. Advanced Persistent Threats</h3>
          <p>Nation-state actors with unlimited budgets, zero-day exploits you've never heard of, and the patience to wait years for the right moment.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><em>The Law of Fives never fails.</em> There are always five ways nation-states can compromise your security, and these are just the ones we know about.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="approved-crypto">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The "Approved Algorithms" Paradox</h2>
      
      <p>Let's talk about government-approved cryptography. You know what's interesting? The same organizations that:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Run global surveillance programs</li>
        <li>Employ the world's best cryptanalysts</li>
        <li>Have budgets in the billions for signals intelligence</li>
        <li>Legally compromise tech companies</li>
        <li>Intercept hardware in transit to install backdoors</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>...are the <em>same organizations</em> that certify which encryption algorithms are "safe" for everyone to use.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Isn't that convenient?</strong></p>
      
      <p>This isn't to say modern cryptography is worthless—breaking AES-256 with a proper implementation and key management is <em>computationally infeasible</em> (for now). But here's the thing: they don't need to break the algorithm when they can:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Compromise the implementation</strong> (Dual_EC_DRBG, anyone?)</li>
        <li><strong>Steal the keys</strong> (via legal access, supply chain, or exploitation)</li>
        <li><strong>Attack the endpoints</strong> (your device is the weak link, not the math)</li>
        <li><strong>Exploit the metadata</strong> (they don't need content when they know who talks to whom, when, and how often)</li>
        <li><strong>Wait for quantum computing</strong> (store now, decrypt later)</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>See? The Law of Fives strikes again. There are always five ways around your "secure" encryption.</p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Discordian Solution: Radical Transparency</h2>
      
      <p>So what do we do? Give up? Use rot13 and hope for the best?</p>
      
      <p><strong>No.</strong> We embrace transparency as the real security mechanism.</p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, we practice <strong>radical transparency</strong> through our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">Public ISMS</a>. Why?</p>

          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Trust Through Verification</h3>
          <p>Don't trust our security practices—<em>verify them.</em> Our policies, procedures, and frameworks are public. You can see exactly how we handle security.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>No Security Theater</h3>
          <p>We don't pretend nation-states can't compromise systems. We design for resilience, detection, and recovery—not for imaginary perfect security.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Business Value Over Buzzwords</h3>
          <p>Security investments should deliver <strong>measurable ROI</strong>: reduced breach costs, operational efficiency, customer trust, and competitive advantage.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Truth Shall Set You Free (Sort Of)</h2>
      
      <p>Here's what we've learned from the Law of Fives:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>No crypto is truly secure</strong> from nation-state adversaries with full-spectrum capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>Government-approved algorithms</strong> are approved by people whose job is breaking things</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency beats obscurity</strong> because trust requires verification, not faith</li>
        <li><strong>Real security is resilience</strong>—not imaginary perfect protection</li>
        <li><strong>Security investments should deliver measurable ROI</strong>—not just fear-driven spending</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> Embrace the chaos. Question the approved narratives. Build security that <em>actually works</em> in the real threat landscape.</p>
      
      <p>And remember: <em>The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.</em> Don't let compliance theater replace actual security thinking.</p>
