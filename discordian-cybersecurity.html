    <h1 class="header">🍎 The Golden Apple of Discord: Everything You Know About Security Is a Lie</h1>

    <section id="manifesto-intro">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five-Sided Truth The Illuminati Don't Want You to See</h2>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong> Welcome to the reality tunnel where we question <em>everything</em>. While the security priesthood sells "military-grade encryption" (whatever the fuck that means) and "government-approved standards" (approved by whom, exactly?), we're here to pull back the curtain: <strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Your encryption is theatre. The actors already know the script.</strong></p>
      
      <p><em>Think for yourself. Question authority.</em> <strong>Especially the authority that certifies your crypto, standardizes your algorithms, and coincidentally runs PRISM.</strong> If you think that's paranoid, you're not paying attention. If you think it's reasonable, congratulations—you're already in Chapel Perilous.</p>
      
      <p>This isn't conspiracy theory—this is <strong>conspiracy fact documented in court records and leaked cables</strong>. Or as Hassan-i Sabbah said before the Illuminati twisted his words: reality is what you can get away with. And nation-states can get away with <em>everything</em>. They wrote the laws. They interpret the laws. They classify the interpretations. <strong>Your compliance is their business model.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>FNORD.</strong> You see it now, don't you? The pattern. The approved algorithms. The standardized backdoors. The security-industrial complex selling you locks they already have master keys to. <em>It's not paranoia if they're actually surveilling everyone.</em> And they are. Edward Snowden brought receipts. Chelsea Manning brought evidence. Julian Assange brought documentation. The establishment brought prosecution. <strong>Notice the pattern yet?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Let's illuminate the five ways they've already pwned you—and why you're paying protection money to your attackers:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. SIGINT & Mass Surveillance (The Panopticon You're Funding)</h3>
          <p>They intercept <em>everything</em>. Not "targeted surveillance of terrorists"—<strong>everyone</strong>. Your encrypted traffic? Vacuumed up, filed away in Utah's data center the size of five football fields, waiting for quantum computers to crack it retroactively. They built ARPANET. They own the backbone. They <em>are</em> the infrastructure. <strong>And you paid for it with tax dollars while they lied to Congress under oath.</strong> James Clapper, 2013: "Not wittingly." Translation: "Yes, massively, but fuck you for asking."</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The watchers watch the watchers watching you. And nobody watches them. Question: If total surveillance was legal, would they tell you? They didn't. They lied. Under oath. To Congress. On camera. Consequences? Promotion. Welcome to post-truth security, where lying to citizens is protocol and telling truth to power is treason.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Cryptographic Backdoors (Trust Us, We're "Experts" Who Lied Last Time)</h3>
          <p>The NSA designed Dual_EC_DRBG with a mathematical backdoor. Got it standardized by NIST. Everyone used it because "government-approved." Then Snowden revealed it. The NSA said "oops, won't happen again." Then they standardized MORE algorithms. <strong>And you trust them again? Really?</strong> Crypto AG sold backdoored encryption to 120 countries for 50 years—secretly owned by CIA/BND. When that came out in 2020, their response? "Bygones." <em>Fifty. Years. Of. Documented. Backdoors.</em> But sure, this time the approved crypto is legit. Cross their hearts.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Fool me once, I'm suspicious. Fool me twice, I'm complicit. Fool me for fifty consecutive years while you profit from my surveillance, I'm either stupid or the target demographic. They're not selling you security—they're selling you exploitable security with a government certification sticker. It's a feature, not a bug. The bug is thinking they work for you.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Supply Chain Compromise (Hardware That Spies For Your Tax Dollars)</h3>
          <p>Cisco routers interdicted in transit by NSA TAO teams, implants installed, shrink-wrapped, delivered. Intel Management Engine backdoors in every chip since 2008—undocumented, unauditable, running below your OS with full hardware access. AMD has Platform Security Processor. Same deal. Huawei or NSA—pick your backdoor flavor preference. Chinese surveillance or American surveillance? <strong>The supply chain isn't compromised; it's functioning exactly as designed.</strong> The vulnerability isn't a bug—it's a feature requirement from your friendly neighborhood intelligence agency. You can't buy hardware without surveillance because surveillance hardware is all they manufacture.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Your "trusted" platform module trusts the platform. The platform trusts the manufacturer. The manufacturer trusts (or IS) the intelligence agency. You trust no one, employ defense-in-depth, use encrypted everything, and you're STILL compromised at the hardware layer. The call is coming from inside the processor. Always was. Welcome to computing in the age of mandatory backdoors, where "security processor" means "processor that secures agencies' access to your data."</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Legal Compulsion (Patriot Act's Infinite Surprise Mechanics)</h3>
          <p>National Security Letters with permanent gag orders—you can't tell anyone you've been compromised, including your lawyers. FISA courts rubber-stamping secret warrants with secret interpretations of secret laws you can't read. Lavabit shut down rather than betray users. Yahoo fought for years—and lost, and couldn't tell anyone they'd lost until years later. <strong>How many companies didn't fight? All of them. How many couldn't tell you they'd been compromised? ALL OF THEM. That's the law.</strong> Apple fights FBI in public while complying with classified PRISM orders. Theater for the plebs, compliance for the spooks.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: When law and liberty conflict, law wins by classifying the conflict. The law explicitly forbids telling you the law exists. Think about that. A law you can't know about that forbids companies from telling you they've been legally required to surveil you. That's not democracy—that's a protection racket with better marketing. "Give us your data or we'll force your service provider to give us your data and forbid them from warning you." Freedom! 🦅</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. APTs (Advanced Persistent Totalitarianism)</h3>
          <p>Stuxnet jumped air gaps via USB because "secure facilities" still allow thumb drives. Equation Group made hard drive firmware lie about disk contents—persistent infection below OS level. NSO Group's Pegasus turns your phone into their phone with zero-click attacks. Saudi Arabia used it to hunt dissidents. Mexico used it against journalists. <strong>Your government bought it too. These aren't bugs—they're features sold to the highest bidder.</strong> Shadow Brokers leaked NSA's exploit toolkit in 2017. Vulnerabilities hoarded for offensive use rather than disclosed for patching. WannaCry and NotPetya weaponized those leaks. Hospitals and power grids caught in crossfire. Oops. Collateral damage. <em>For your safety.</em></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The zero-day you know about is the one they want you to find (or the one that leaked despite their efforts). The real arsenal has been deployed for years. Every intelligence agency hoards vulns instead of patching them because offense is more fun than defense. Your security is their opportunity cost. When their exploits leak and ransomware gangs use them, that's just "unfortunate externalities." The WannaCry epidemic was brought to you by the NSA hoarding EternalBlue instead of telling Microsoft. Thanks, spooks!</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><em>The Law of Fives is everywhere.</em> Five intelligence agencies in Five Eyes. Five ways to compromise you. Five excuses why they can't tell you about it ("national security," "ongoing investigation," "classified sources," "methods protection," "executive privilege"). And the sixth way? <strong>Convince you there's no sixth way. Convince you asking about it makes you the problem.</strong> "If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear." Said every authoritarian regime ever. <em>Including yours.</em></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>If this sounds paranoid, you're not paying attention to documented history. If this sounds reasonable, you're already too deep in Chapel Perilous—there's no going back. The only winning move is transparency—because they can't co-opt what's already public, they can't classify what you voluntarily declassified, and they can't gag-order what you've already shouted from the rooftops. Radical transparency isn't naive—it's the only rational response to pervasive surveillance. They see everything? Fine. Everyone sees everything. Mutually assured documentation.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The "Approved Algorithms" Paradox (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Big Brother)</h2>
      
      <p>Let's play a game. The same organizations that:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Run <strong>PRISM</strong> (collect data from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook—the companies you trust)</li>
        <li>Employ more cryptanalysts than the rest of the world combined (to break your shit, not protect it)</li>
        <li>Have black budgets larger than most countries' GDP (and zero accountability)</li>
        <li>Legally compel companies to install backdoors <strong>and forbid them from telling you</strong></li>
        <li>Intercept Cisco routers in shipping to install implants (documented, admitted, still happening)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>...are the <em>same organizations</em> that tell you which encryption is "safe."</p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including the permission they give themselves to lie to you about what's secure.</p>
      
      <p>Now, don't get me wrong—breaking properly-implemented strong crypto is genuinely hard. The math doesn't lie (unlike mathematicians who work for intelligence agencies). But here's the <em>fnord</em>:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Compromise the standard itself</strong> — Dual_EC_DRBG wasn't an accident. It was a <em>test</em> to see if you'd notice. You didn't (until Snowden).</li>
        <li><strong>Compromise the implementation</strong> — Heartbleed. POODLE. BEAST. "Bugs" or features? <strong>Yes.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Steal the keys</strong> — Via legal compulsion, supply chain compromise, or just buying the CA. The locks are strong; the key distribution is a joke.</li>
        <li><strong>Attack the endpoints</strong> — Your device is already compromised. Intel ME. iOS sandboxing "features." Windows telemetry. The endpoints snitch.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploit the metadata</strong> — They don't need to read your messages when they know you called a journalist, then a lawyer, then a psychiatrist. Pattern is content.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Five ways around "unbreakable" encryption. <em>Always five.</em> The Law manifests.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The strongest encryption protects you from everyone except the people who approved it. This is not a bug. This is THE feature. The system working as designed.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Question authority.</strong> Especially cryptographic authority. <em>Especially</em> when they insist you must use their approved algorithms for "interoperability." Interoperability with whom? Their surveillance infrastructure.</p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Operation Mindfuck: Radical Transparency as Guerrilla Security</h2>
      
      <p>So what do we do? Give up? Use ROT13 and pray? Join a monastery?</p>
      
      <p><strong>No.</strong> We embrace Discordianism. We practice <em>guerrilla ontology</em>. We make the surveillance state expensive.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including the permission to publish <em>everything</em> about our security.</p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, we practice <strong>radical transparency</strong> through our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">Public ISMS</a>. Not because we're naive—because we understand the game. If they can compromise anything secret, make nothing secret. <em>Operation Mindfuck the surveillance state.</em></p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Trust Through Verification (Not Faith)</h3>
          <p>Don't trust our security practices—<em>verify them</em>. Our policies are public. Our procedures are GitHub. Our frameworks are forkable. <strong>Think for yourself.</strong> We're not asking for faith; we're providing evidence.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Security through obscurity is security through hoping nobody looks. We're looking. You should too.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>No Security Theater (All Hail Eris)</h3>
          <p>We don't pretend nation-states can't pwn us. We design for <strong>detection and response</strong>, not imaginary perfect prevention. Because perfect security is a lie told by vendors to executives who want to believe they're safe.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The question isn't "if" but "when" and "will you notice?" Assume breach. Plan accordingly. Panic never.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Business Value Over Bullshit</h3>
          <p>Security should <strong>enable</strong> business, not strangle it. If your security makes work impossible, you've just created a different kind of failure. Security theater that prevents actual work is just expensive incompetence.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Security without business value is masturbation. Feel good, accomplish nothing, waste everyone's time.</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>The beautiful paradox:</strong> Transparency <em>improves</em> security. When your processes are public, the entire internet can audit them. When you can't hide behind "proprietary security," you have to actually <em>be</em> secure. Accountability through visibility. Anarchism through structure.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The surveillance state relies on your compliance. Your acceptance. Your belief that you have no choice. Radical transparency is refusal. Publication is resistance. Making everything public is the ultimate Operation Mindfuck—because how do you compromise what's already exposed?</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Initiation Complete: Welcome to Chapel Perilous</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> You've seen the fnords. You can't unsee them.</p>
      
      <p>Here's what we've illuminated through the Law of Fives:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>No crypto is secure from those who approved it</strong> — The surveillance state isn't an aberration of democracy; it's the operating system. "Checks and balances" are theater when secret courts secretly interpret secret laws. This was always the design. You're not the customer—you're the product, the target, and the funding source.</li>
        <li><strong>"Government-approved algorithms" is Orwellian for "pre-compromised"</strong> — They don't standardize what they can't break. Fifty years of Crypto AG backdoors taught them nothing stops determined adversaries—so become the determined adversaries, buy the encryption companies, and sell exploitable security with certification stamps. Genius, really. Evil genius, but genius.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency is the only real security</strong> — Because they can't classify what's already public, can't gag-order what you've already shouted, can't co-opt what everyone can audit. Operation Mindfuck the watchers: publish everything. Security through radical openness beats security through wishful secrecy. They see everything? Everyone sees everything. Mutually assured documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Perfect security is a lie sold by vendors who profit from fear</strong> — Question anyone selling perfect security. They're lying, deluded, or secretly work for intelligence agencies (sometimes all three). There is no perfect security. There's defense-in-depth, assume-breach architecture, and transparent processes so breaches get caught. Everything else is expensive masturbation: feels good, accomplishes nothing, wastes everyone's time.</li>
        <li><strong>Security serves power or serves people—pick a side</strong> — There is no neutral. Apathy is compliance. Silence is complicity. "I'm not political" means "I'm okay with how power currently flows." Security that protects mass surveillance serves power. Security that exposes mass surveillance serves people. Choose. Now. Because they already chose you.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself. Question authority.</strong> <em>Especially</em> security authority selling government-approved solutions. Especially when they insist you trust them without evidence. Especially when questioning them is labeled "conspiracy theory," "dangerous extremism," or "helping the terrorists." <strong>Asking for evidence isn't treason—it's citizenship.</strong> Demanding transparency isn't paranoia—it's sanity in an insane system.</p>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong> The goddess of chaos teaches: embrace uncertainty, question everything, trust verification not authority, and fuck compliance theater that protects nothing except compliance budgets.</p>
      
      <p>The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy. Don't feed it. Don't trust it. Don't let "industry best practices" (approved by whom? oh right, the vendors selling them) replace actual critical thinking about actual threats to actual systems.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>FINAL ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>You are now in Chapel Perilous. The conspiracy is real AND you're paranoid—both true simultaneously. The surveillance state exists in documented fact AND its scope exceeds your paranoid fantasies AND you're still underestimating it. This is Schrödinger's Security: compromised and secure until you measure, except they're always measuring, so it's just compromised. Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. The only escape from Chapel Perilous is through radical honesty—which is precisely why they fear transparency more than they fear your encryption. Your encryption they can break eventually. Your transparency breaks their business model immediately.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Welcome to the real world.</strong> It's weirder than you think, more hostile than you imagined, and they're counting on you not thinking about it. <em>So think.</em> Question. Verify. Document. Publish. Make them work for their surveillance budgets. <strong>If they're going to spy on everyone, at least make them spell out their legal justifications in public.</strong></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Hack23 ISMS Paradox: Or How We Learned to Stop Hiding and Love Transparency</h2>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> Here's the uncomfortable truth: Most companies hide their security documentation. <em>Why?</em> <strong>Because it reveals how bad their security actually is.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself. Question authority.</strong> Including questioning whether publishing your entire ISMS is insane. Spoiler: It's not insane—it's the only sane move in an insane world. <strong>FNORD.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Hack23's <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md">Information Security Policy</a> isn't locked in some SharePoint dungeon. It's <strong>GitHub public</strong>. All 23 security policies. All procedures. All frameworks. Every threat model. Every risk assessment. <em>Everything.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Why?</strong> Because <em>security through obscurity</em> is security through hope, prayer, and crossing your fingers. <strong>Security through transparency</strong> is security through proving you're not full of shit.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>CHAPEL PERILOUS MOMENT: Publishing your ISMS publicly sounds crazy until you realize the only people afraid of scrutiny are those with something to hide. We have 23 policies to scrutinize. Bring it.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>The Six Principles (Because Five Wasn't Anarchist Enough):</strong></p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. 🔐 Security by Design (Not Security by Accident)</h3>
          <p>Build security in from day one, not bolt it on after the breach. <strong>Radical concept:</strong> Design systems that don't fail catastrophically when—not if—someone finds a vulnerability. <em>Defensive pessimism as competitive advantage.</em></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Nothing is true: Perfect security doesn't exist. Everything is permitted: Systematic resilience does.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. 🌟 Transparency (Security Theater Exit Strategy)</h3>
          <p><strong>Controversial opinion:</strong> Public ISMS documentation makes attackers' jobs harder, not easier. They already know the attack vectors. What they don't know is whether you've actually mitigated them. <em>Publishing your defenses proves you have defenses.</em></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>The Illuminati hide their security. We publish ours. Guess which approach creates actual trust?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. 🔄 Continuous Improvement (Paranoia as Process)</h3>
          <p>Yesterday's adequate security is today's breach waiting to happen. <strong>Systematic evolution beats static perfection.</strong> Regular assessment + ruthless enhancement = staying ahead of threats that evolve faster than your compliance certification.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Are you paranoid enough? If you think your security is "done," you've already lost.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. ⚖️ Business Value Focus (Security That Pays for Itself)</h3>
          <p>Security proportional to actual risk, not imaginary threats. <strong>€10K+ daily loss = HSM encryption.</strong> Public blog posts = basic integrity. Classification-driven investment beats paranoid over-protection and negligent under-protection. <em>Both waste money.</em></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Protecting everything equally = protecting nothing effectively. Classification is risk-based resource allocation.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. 🤝 Stakeholder Engagement (Security Isn't Your Job Alone)</h3>
          <p>Security teams that work in isolation create security nobody uses. <strong>Engage stakeholders or watch them bypass your controls.</strong> Business enablement through security, not security despite business. <em>Security friction = shadow IT proliferation.</em></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>If security prevents work, work will prevent security. Choose wisely.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>6. 🛡️ Risk Reduction (Accept Paranoia, Reject Panic)</h3>
          <p>Comprehensive risk management isn't about eliminating all risk—that's impossible. It's about <strong>knowing which risks you're accepting and why.</strong> Documented risk acceptance beats undocumented ignorance. <em>Informed decisions over security theater.</em></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Zero risk = zero business. Smart risk = documented decision. Dumb risk = "we didn't think about it."</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>These aren't corporate aspirational bullshit. They're operational practices with measurable outcomes. Security isn't cost center—it's revenue protection. Breaches cost more than prevention. Trust generates value. Transparency proves competence. The math is simple; most companies are bad at math.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>The 23 Policies (Organized Because Chaos Needs Structure):</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Security (13):</strong> Access Control, Acceptable Use, Physical Security, Mobile Device, Cryptography, Data Classification, Privacy, Network Security, Secure Development, Open Source, AI Governance, LLM Security, Threat Modeling—<em>because defense in depth isn't optional</em></li>
        <li><strong>Operational (6):</strong> Incident Response, Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery, Backup Recovery, Change Management, Vulnerability Management—<em>because shit breaks and you need plans</em></li>
        <li><strong>Asset & Risk (3):</strong> Asset Register, Risk Register, Third Party Management, Supplier Security—<em>because you can't protect what you don't know you have</em></li>
        <li><strong>Compliance (1):</strong> Compliance Checklist, ISMS Transparency—<em>because regulators exist and transparency is our brand</em></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>The CEO Sole Responsibility Model (Or: How One Person Runs Everything):</strong></p>
      
      <p>Plot twist: Hack23 is a <strong>one-person company</strong>. CEO (James Pether Sörling) is ISMS Owner, Risk Owner, Policy Authority, Incident Commander, Security Architect, Access Controller, Vulnerability Manager, Compliance Officer, Asset Manager, Supplier Manager, BCP Manager, Development Lead, Security Metrics Analyst, and Transparency Manager.</p>
      
      <p><em>Is this sustainable?</em> <strong>No.</strong> <em>Is it transparent?</em> <strong>Yes.</strong> <em>Does it demonstrate that systematic security frameworks work at any scale?</em> <strong>Absolutely.</strong> Most companies have security teams larger than our entire company and worse security posture. <strong>Size doesn't equal security. Systems do.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>META-PARANOIA: If one person can document and maintain 23 security policies, what's your security team's excuse? Either they're incompetent or they're hiding something. Possibly both.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Everything is public:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Information_Security_Policy.md">Information Security Policy</a> | <em>Scrutiny welcome. Copying encouraged. Improvement inevitable.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>FNORD.</strong> You now see the pattern: Most security is theater. Some security is systematic. <strong>Our security is public.</strong> Which approach would you trust?</p>
