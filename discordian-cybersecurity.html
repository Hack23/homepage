    <section id="manifesto-intro">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five-Sided Truth The Illuminati Don't Want You to See</h2>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong> Welcome to the reality tunnel where we question <em>everything</em>. While the security priesthood sells "military-grade encryption" and "government-approved standards," we're here to pull back the curtain: <strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Your encryption is theatre.</strong></p>
      
      <p><em>Think for yourself. Question authority.</em> Especially the authority that certifies your crypto.</p>
      
      <p>This isn't conspiracy theory—this is <strong>conspiracy fact</strong>. Or as Hassan-i Sabbah said before the Illuminati twisted his words: reality is what you can get away with. And nation-states can get away with <em>everything</em>.</p>
      
      <p><strong>FNORD.</strong> You see it now, don't you? The pattern. The approved algorithms. The standardized backdoors. The security industrial complex selling you locks they already have keys to.</p>
      
      <p>Let's illuminate the five ways they've already pwned you:</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. SIGINT & Mass Surveillance (The Panopticon Is Real)</h3>
          <p>They intercept <em>everything</em>. Not "targeted surveillance"—<strong>everything</strong>. Your encrypted traffic? Filed away in Utah, waiting for quantum computers. They built the internet. They tap the backbone. They <em>are</em> the infrastructure.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The watchers watch the watchers watching you. And nobody watches them. Question: If total surveillance was legal, would they tell you? They didn't.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Cryptographic Backdoors (Trust Us, We're Experts)</h3>
          <p>The NSA designed Dual_EC_DRBG with a backdoor. Got it standardized. Everyone used it. Then Snowden revealed it. The NSA said "oops." Then they standardized more algorithms. <strong>And you trust them again?</strong></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Fool me once, I'm suspicious. Fool me twice, I'm complicit. Fool me seventeen times, I'm working for you.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Supply Chain Compromise (Hardware Betrayal)</h3>
          <p>Cisco routers interdicted in transit. IME backdoors in every Intel chip since 2008. Huawei or NSA—pick your backdoor flavor. The supply chain isn't compromised; <strong>it's designed that way</strong>.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Your trusted platform module trusts the platform. The platform trusts the manufacturer. The manufacturer trusts the intelligence agency. You trust no one, and you're still compromised.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Legal Compulsion (Patriot Act Surprise Mechanics)</h3>
          <p>National Security Letters with gag orders. FISA courts with secret interpretations of secret laws. Lavabit shut down rather than comply. Yahoo fought and lost. <strong>How many didn't fight? How many couldn't tell you?</strong></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: When law and liberty conflict, guess which one survives. The law explicitly forbids telling you it exists. Think about that.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. APTs (Advanced Persistent Everything)</h3>
          <p>Stuxnet jumped air gaps. Equation Group made hard drives lie about their firmware. NSO Group turns your phone into their phone. These aren't bugs—they're <strong>features</strong> of the surveillance state.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The zero-day you know about is the one they want you to find. The real ones have been there for years.</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><em>The Law of Fives is everywhere.</em> Five intelligence agencies. Five eyes. Five ways to compromise you. And the sixth way? <strong>Convince you there's no sixth way.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>If this sounds paranoid, you're not paying attention. If this sounds reasonable, you're already too deep. The only winning move is transparency—because they can't co-opt what's already public.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="approved-crypto">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The "Approved Algorithms" Paradox (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Big Brother)</h2>
      
      <p>Let's play a game. The same organizations that:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Run <strong>PRISM</strong> (collect data from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook—the companies you trust)</li>
        <li>Employ more cryptanalysts than the rest of the world combined (to break your shit, not protect it)</li>
        <li>Have black budgets larger than most countries' GDP (and zero accountability)</li>
        <li>Legally compel companies to install backdoors <strong>and forbid them from telling you</strong></li>
        <li>Intercept Cisco routers in shipping to install implants (documented, admitted, still happening)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>...are the <em>same organizations</em> that tell you which encryption is "safe."</p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including the permission they give themselves to lie to you about what's secure.</p>
      
      <p>Now, don't get me wrong—breaking properly-implemented strong crypto is genuinely hard. The math doesn't lie (unlike mathematicians who work for intelligence agencies). But here's the <em>fnord</em>:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Compromise the standard itself</strong> — Dual_EC_DRBG wasn't an accident. It was a <em>test</em> to see if you'd notice. You didn't (until Snowden).</li>
        <li><strong>Compromise the implementation</strong> — Heartbleed. POODLE. BEAST. "Bugs" or features? <strong>Yes.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Steal the keys</strong> — Via legal compulsion, supply chain compromise, or just buying the CA. The locks are strong; the key distribution is a joke.</li>
        <li><strong>Attack the endpoints</strong> — Your device is already compromised. Intel ME. iOS sandboxing "features." Windows telemetry. The endpoints snitch.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploit the metadata</strong> — They don't need to read your messages when they know you called a journalist, then a lawyer, then a psychiatrist. Pattern is content.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Five ways around "unbreakable" encryption. <em>Always five.</em> The Law manifests.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The strongest encryption protects you from everyone except the people who approved it. This is not a bug. This is THE feature. The system working as designed.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Question authority.</strong> Especially cryptographic authority. <em>Especially</em> when they insist you must use their approved algorithms for "interoperability." Interoperability with whom? Their surveillance infrastructure.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="transparency-solution">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Operation Mindfuck: Radical Transparency as Guerrilla Security</h2>
      
      <p>So what do we do? Give up? Use ROT13 and pray? Join a monastery?</p>
      
      <p><strong>No.</strong> We embrace Discordianism. We practice <em>guerrilla ontology</em>. We make the surveillance state expensive.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including the permission to publish <em>everything</em> about our security.</p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, we practice <strong>radical transparency</strong> through our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">Public ISMS</a>. Not because we're naive—because we understand the game. If they can compromise anything secret, make nothing secret. <em>Operation Mindfuck the surveillance state.</em></p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Trust Through Verification (Not Faith)</h3>
          <p>Don't trust our security practices—<em>verify them</em>. Our policies are public. Our procedures are GitHub. Our frameworks are forkable. <strong>Think for yourself.</strong> We're not asking for faith; we're providing evidence.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Security through obscurity is security through hoping nobody looks. We're looking. You should too.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>No Security Theater (All Hail Eris)</h3>
          <p>We don't pretend nation-states can't pwn us. We design for <strong>detection and response</strong>, not imaginary perfect prevention. Because perfect security is a lie told by vendors to executives who want to believe they're safe.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: The question isn't "if" but "when" and "will you notice?" Assume breach. Plan accordingly. Panic never.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>Business Value Over Bullshit</h3>
          <p>Security should <strong>enable</strong> business, not strangle it. If your security makes work impossible, you've just created a different kind of failure. Security theater that prevents actual work is just expensive incompetence.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Security without business value is masturbation. Feel good, accomplish nothing, waste everyone's time.</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>The beautiful paradox:</strong> Transparency <em>improves</em> security. When your processes are public, the entire internet can audit them. When you can't hide behind "proprietary security," you have to actually <em>be</em> secure. Accountability through visibility. Anarchism through structure.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The surveillance state relies on your compliance. Your acceptance. Your belief that you have no choice. Radical transparency is refusal. Publication is resistance. Making everything public is the ultimate Operation Mindfuck—because how do you compromise what's already exposed?</em></p>

      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> You've seen the fnords. You can't unsee them.</p>
      
      <p>Here's what we've illuminated through the Law of Fives:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>No crypto is secure from those who approved it</strong> — The surveillance state is the system, not an aberration. This was always the design.</li>
        <li><strong>"Approved algorithms" is newspeak for "exploitable"</strong> — They don't standardize what they can't compromise. Think for yourself about why that is.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency is the only real security</strong> — Because they can't co-opt what's already public. Operation Mindfuck the watchers.</li>
        <li><strong>Perfect security is a noble lie</strong> — Question anyone selling it. They're either lying or deluded. Usually both.</li>
        <li><strong>Security serves power or serves people</strong> — Choose sides. There is no neutral. Apathy is compliance.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself. Question authority.</strong> <em>Especially</em> security authority. Especially when they insist you trust them. Especially when questioning them is labeled "dangerous."</p>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong> The goddess of chaos teaches: embrace uncertainty. Question everything. Trust verification. Fuck compliance theater.</p>
      
      <p>The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy. Don't feed it. Don't trust it. Don't let "best practices" (approved by whom?) replace actual thinking.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>FINAL ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>You are now in Chapel Perilous. The conspiracy is real AND imaginary. The surveillance state exists AND you're paranoid. Both are true. Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. The only way out is through radical honesty—which is why they fear transparency more than your encryption.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Welcome to the real world.</strong> It's weirder than you think, and they're counting on you not thinking about it.</p>
