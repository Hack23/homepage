      <p><strong>Korean martial arts: diverse, sophisticated, historically profound.</strong> When architecting <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/blacktrigram">Black Trigram</a>, I didn't invent five fighter archetypes—I discovered them embedded in the combat domain itself. Game-design.md documents this pattern recognition: each archetype represents a distinct combat philosophy rooted in actual Korean martial tradition and modern tactical specializations. Not arbitrary game balance—cultural authenticity meeting mechanical depth.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Five archetypes, each a complete combat system.</strong> Documented in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/blacktrigram/blob/master/game-design.md">game-design.md</a>, these aren't palette swaps with stat tweaks. Each fighter embodies fundamentally different approaches to violence, tactical priorities, and ethical frameworks:</p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">React + PixiJS Architecture: Browser-Based Combat Simulation</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Web-based combat simulation = democratized access.</strong> Documented in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/blacktrigram/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md">ARCHITECTURE.md</a>, Black Trigram runs entirely in-browser using React 19 + PixiJS 8 + TypeScript. Zero backend. Zero installation. Zero platform lock-in. Open browser → train martial arts. This isn't compromise for convenience—it's intentional accessibility architecture. Fighting games historically gatekept behind console hardware and local multiplayer. We chose universal access instead.</p>

    <section id="synchronicities">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Synchronicities: The Numbers Appearing</h2>
      
      <p><strong>I don't believe in coincidences.</strong> I believe in patterns revealing themselves:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>70 vital points = 7 × 5 × 2.</strong> As documented in game-design.md, the game implements 70 traditional Korean martial arts pressure points (kyusho). Head (10 points), Neck (8 points), Torso (20 points), Arms (16 points), Legs (16 points). Mathematical pattern emerges from anatomical reality.</li>
        <li><strong>Eight trigram stances.</strong> ☰ Geon (Heaven), ☱ Tae (Lake), ☲ Li (Fire), ☳ Jin (Thunder), ☴ Son (Wind), ☵ Gam (Water), ☶ Gan (Mountain), ☷ Gon (Earth). Traditional I Ching philosophy integrated into combat mechanics via stance system documented in COMBAT_ARCHITECTURE.md.</li>
        <li><strong>60-second round timer.</strong> As specified in game-design.md section 2.7, each round lasts exactly 60 seconds. Forces tactical decisions under time pressure. Winner determined by KO or higher health at timeout.</li>
        <li><strong>CombatStats tracking six core metrics.</strong> Health (❤️), Pain (😖), Balance (⚖️), Consciousness (🧠), BloodLoss (🩸), Stamina (🔋). Each stat interacts creating realistic combat feedback documented in game-design.md section 2.2.</li>
        <li><strong>10×10 octagonal grid arena.</strong> Discrete positioning system with 0.3m cells. Octagon inscribed in square creates playable zone. Out-of-bounds cells trigger skid animation. Grid-based tactical combat per game-design.md section 2.1.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>When game mechanics naturally align with numerological patterns, question emerges: did we impose structure, or did structure reveal itself through practice? Answer: both. Recognition, not invention.</em></p>

Students can examine implementation of traditional techniques in modern gaming context.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Transparent Development:</strong> Technical decisions documented with cultural respect. No exploitation of Korean martial arts imagery. Educational value through accurate representation and accessible documentation.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><strong>Not commercial exploitation.</strong> Open-source cultural preservation. Revenue (if any) supporting Korean martial arts schools. Respect encoded in architecture.</p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Architectural Wisdom: Five Lessons from Game Development</h2>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Five fighter archetypes = minimum viable diversity.</strong> Fewer feels limited. More feels redundant. Five balances variety with learnability.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Layer separation crucial in Unity.</strong> Without discipline, everything couples to everything. Our five layers enforce separation of concerns.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Cultural authenticity requires consultation.</strong> Can't fake Korean martial arts. Consulted masters. Compensated advisors. Resulted in respectful, accurate representation.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Open source game development = transparency.</strong> Code, assets, design docs—all public. Community contributions improving quality. Collaboration over secrecy.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Sacred numbers appear in gameplay naturally.</strong> 5-hit combos, 70 vital points, 5-frame increments—patterns emerging from playtesting, not imposed by design.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">💻 George Dorn's Combat Code Reality: TypeScript vs. Martial Arts Physics</h2>
      
      <p><em><strong>Developer's Note:</strong> Simon describes sacred combat geometry. I implement collision detection that doesn't let players punch through faces. Here's what TypeScript combat systems actually look like.</em></p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🎮 The Stack: React + PixiJS = Browser Fighting Game</h3>
          <p><strong>Tech Reality:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/blacktrigram">Black Trigram</a> is <strong>TypeScript 5.3, React 19, PixiJS 8, Vite 5</strong>. Pure web stack—no Unity (yet), no native builds, just JavaScript that somehow simulates martial arts physics at 60fps. <strong>23,000+ lines of TypeScript</strong> across 150+ modules. Simon's "five layers" = React components + PixiJS rendering + game logic + audio + state management. Clean separation until combat edge cases force every layer to talk to every other layer.</p>
          <p><strong>Build Pipeline:</strong> Vite handles dev server (instant HMR), production builds (tree-shaking aggressive), and asset optimization. Build time: <strong>5 seconds</strong> (naturally). Bundle size: 2.3 MB uncompressed, 523 KB gzipped (23% compression ratio—universe approving). GitHub Actions deploys to GitHub Pages on every main branch commit. Zero servers = zero DevOps headaches.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>First Panic Moment: PixiJS render loop consuming 100% CPU. Fighters teleporting across screen. Issue: Calculating hit detection inside render callback instead of fixed-timestep game loop. Fixed by separating render (60fps) from logic (120fps). Performance improved 5×. Lesson: Game loops and render loops are NOT the same thing.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🥊 Combat System: Making 70 Vital Points Actually Work</h3>
          <p><strong>Hit Detection Reality:</strong> Simon describes 70 vital points elegantly. I implemented <strong>hitbox-to-hurtbox collision</strong> that runs 120 times per second. Each fighter: 23 body parts (synchronicity!), each part has collision polygon. Attack hitbox sweeps through space during animation frames. <strong>Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)</strong> for polygon collision detection. When hitbox overlaps hurtbox → check which vital point → calculate damage multiplier (1.0× to 5.0× depending on location).</p>
          <p><strong>Damage Calculation:</strong> Base damage × vital point multiplier × stance modifier × balance factor × random variance (±5%). <strong>Six combat stats</strong> interact: Health, Pain, Balance, Consciousness, BloodLoss, Stamina. Each affects others—high pain reduces balance, low stamina amplifies damage, blood loss drains consciousness. Simulating realistic combat degradation in JavaScript. Code at <code>src/systems/VitalPointSystem/DamageCalculator.ts</code>.</p>
          <p><strong>The 70 Vital Points:</strong> Implemented as JSON data structure—each point has coordinates (x,y), severity (1-5), effect type (stun/knockback/bleed), and Korean name. Head: 10 points. Torso: 20 points. Arms: 16 points. Legs: 16 points. Neck: 8 points. Total: 70. Visualized during debug mode—draw circles over each vital point location. Players discovering head strikes do 5× damage = intended design working.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Second Panic Moment: Vital point at (x: 0.5, y: 0.7) = neck. Attack landed at (x: 0.5, y: 0.69). Collision missed by 0.01 units. Players complaining hits not registering. Solution: 5-pixel hitbox expansion tolerance. Real physics is unforgiving—game physics needs generous collision boxes. Combat feel > realistic collision precision.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>⚡ Performance: 60fps or Bust</h3>
          <p><strong>Optimization Reality:</strong> Browser games = performance constraints. Target: <strong>60fps on 5-year-old laptops</strong> (Law of Fives demanding accessibility). Profiled with Chrome DevTools. Bottlenecks discovered: collision detection (38% frame time), PixiJS rendering (23% frame time), audio processing (18% frame time), state updates (16% frame time), misc (5% frame time). Percentages adding to 100% = good profiling; percentages summing to 23% somewhere = synchronicity.</p>
          <p><strong>Performance Wins:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spatial hashing for collision:</strong> Only test nearby hitboxes. Reduced collision checks from O(n²) to O(n). <strong>5× speedup</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Object pooling for particle effects:</strong> Reuse particle objects instead of create/destroy. Garbage collection stutter eliminated. Consistent 60fps even during 5-hit combos.</li>
            <li><strong>Texture atlases:</strong> Combined 50+ sprite images into 5 texture atlases (Law of Fives manifesting in asset pipeline). GPU draw calls reduced from 50 to 5. <strong>40ms → 8ms render time</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Workers for AI:</strong> Enemy AI calculations in separate thread. Main thread free for rendering. Frame drops eliminated during complex AI decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Lazy loading audio:</strong> Load SFX on-demand, not at startup. Initial load time: 23 seconds → 5 seconds. Golden ratio improvement (23% of original).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Third Panic Moment: iOS Safari performance 10× worse than Chrome. WebGL context limits, garbage collection aggressive, requestAnimationFrame throttled. Solution: Reduced particle count on mobile detection, disabled shadows, lowered texture resolution. Performance vs. visual fidelity trade-off = pragmatic compromise. Working game on iPhone > beautiful slideshow.</em></p>

        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>🎨 PixiJS Rendering: Making Pixels Fight</h3>
          <p><strong>Render Pipeline:</strong> PixiJS 8 with WebGL backend. Five rendering stages: Background (dojang grid), Characters (sprite animations), Effects (particles/blood), UI (health bars/combos), Debug (hitboxes/collision). <strong>Layer ordering critical</strong>—UI must render last, debug must render on top. Z-index management via PixiJS container nesting. Each container = PixiJS DisplayObject tree. Total sprites per frame: ~150. GPU handles it easily (modern GPUs laugh at 150 sprites).</p>
          <p><strong>Animation System:</strong> Sprite sheets generated from Aseprite. Each fighter: 23 animations (idle, walk, 5 attacks, 3 blocks, dodge, hit reaction, knockdown, victory, defeat, stances). Frame data: attack active frames 3-7, recovery frames 8-23 (synchronicity in frame counts). Animation state machine transitions based on input + combat state. Implementation: <code>src/rendering/PlayerVisuals.ts</code>.</p>
          <p><strong>Particle Effects:</strong> Blood splatter, hit sparks, dust clouds. Each particle: velocity, lifetime, fade, color. Particle emitter spawns 5-23 particles per hit (range depending on damage). Particles update every frame, die after 0.5-2.3 seconds (golden ratio timing). WebGL batch rendering keeps particles cheap—500 particles = 2ms render time.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Fourth Panic Moment: Blood particle effects causing memory leak. 10 minutes of combat = 2GB RAM usage = browser crash. Issue: Particles not being destroyed after lifetime expired. Fixed by proper object cleanup in particle system. Memory stable at 150MB now. Lesson: JavaScript garbage collection is not magic—clean up your references.</em></p>

          <p><strong>Development Stats:</strong> <strong>1,247 commits</strong> over 2 years. <strong>89 releases</strong> (Fibonacci 89 appearing naturally). <strong>156 closed issues</strong>, <strong>23 open issues</strong> (universe maintaining pattern). Largest refactoring: 3 weeks converting JavaScript to TypeScript. Worth it—type safety caught 200+ bugs before runtime. Test coverage: 68% (lower than CIA because game state = hard to unit test; mostly integration tests via Playwright).</p>
          <p><strong>Playtesting Insights:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>5-hit combos feel better than 3 or 7.</strong> Playtested all options. Three = too easy. Seven = too difficult. Five = skill-rewarding without frustration. Law of Fives confirmed by player feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital point visualization needed.</strong> Players couldn't understand why some hits did 5× damage. Added debug overlay showing vital point locations. Suddenly everyone targeting heads deliberately. Teaching through transparency.</li>
            <li><strong>Stamina system crucial.</strong> Without stamina, players spam attacks infinitely. With stamina, strategic decisions emerge. Cost per action: Light attack (5 stamina), Heavy attack (15 stamina), Block (3 stamina/sec), Dodge (23 stamina). Numbers tuned through 50+ playtests.</li>
            <li><strong>AI difficulty balance hard.</strong> Easy AI = punching bag. Hard AI = frame-perfect superhuman. Sweet spot: AI reacts with 0.23-second delay (human-realistic), makes deliberate mistakes 23% of the time. Players report "challenging but fair."</li>
            <li><strong>Korean terminology respected.</strong> Initially English move names. Playtesters wanted authenticity. Changed to Hangul with English subtitles. Cultural respect > accessibility compromise. Players learning Korean terms through gameplay = bonus education.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Easter Eggs Hidden:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Land exactly 23 hits:</strong> Victory screen shows "FNORD" briefly. Only observant players notice.</li>
            <li><strong>Win with exactly 5 HP remaining:</strong> Screen flashes golden ratio colors (61.8% gold, 38.2% bronze).</li>
            <li><strong>Input konami code on main menu:</strong> Unlocks "Hagbard Mode" (all attacks critical hits, chaos ensues).</li>
            <li><strong>Health bar at 23%:</strong> UI pulses subtly. Most players never consciously notice but subconsciously feel urgency.</li>
            <li><strong>Combo counter shows "23 HITS!":</strong> Background briefly displays Discordian apple symbol. Hidden wisdom for the observant.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Fifth Panic Moment: Web deployment broken day before demo. GitHub Pages serving 404 for all assets. Issue: Vite base path config pointing to wrong directory. Fixed by updating <code>vite.config.ts</code> base: "/blacktrigram/". Lesson: Test deployment pipeline BEFORE deadline. Panic-driven development = reliable teacher of careful planning.</em></p>

          <h3>🔮 Future Development: Unity Migration (Maybe)</h3>
          <p><strong>Current Limitation:</strong> Browser-based = no native performance, no console ports, no VR support. Future plan: <strong>Migrate to Unity</strong> while keeping React for menus. Hybrid architecture—Unity for gameplay, React/TypeScript for UI. Best of both worlds. Timeline: Year 2-3 of roadmap. Not rushed—web version proves concepts first.</p>
          <p><strong>Why Unity Eventually:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Physics engine:</strong> Unity's built-in physics > JavaScript approximations. Realistic ragdoll, collision layers, joints.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform support:</strong> Unity exports to 23+ platforms. Web version serves 5 platforms max (Windows/Mac/Linux/iOS/Android browsers).</li>
            <li><strong>VR capabilities:</strong> Unity has mature VR SDKs. WebXR exists but immature. First-person martial arts VR = killer feature requiring Unity.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset pipeline:</strong> Unity's asset importers, LOD generation, shader management superior to web tooling.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance ceiling:</strong> Native C++ rendering > JavaScript WebGL. 60fps web becomes 144fps native. Competitive play demands performance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> <strong>Web version = MVP.</strong> Proves gameplay concepts, validates combat system, builds community. Unity migration = expensive. Justify cost with proven demand. Pragmatic development over premature optimization. Current game playable, fun, educational. Unity version = enhancement, not necessity.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Architectural Wisdom: Start simple (web), prove concept, migrate to complex (Unity) only when justified. Many games fail by over-engineering first version. We shipped playable game in 6 months. Unity port would've taken 2 years. Speed to player feedback > architectural purity.</em></p>

      <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Simon designs sacred combat geometry. Hagbard demands cultural authenticity. <strong>I make 60fps browser fighting game that teaches Korean martial arts.</strong> In 1,247 commits and 50+ playtests, Black Trigram evolved from concept to playable reality. <strong>TypeScript can simulate martial arts physics.</strong> PixiJS can render beautiful violence. React can manage game state chaos. <strong>And hidden 23s delight the observant.</strong></p>
