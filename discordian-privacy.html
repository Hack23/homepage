    <section id="intro">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">If You're Not Paying, You're the Product</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Except harvesting user data without consent—GDPR made that <em>expensive</em>.</p>
      
      <p><em>Think for yourself. Question authority.</em> Especially the authority that says "we value your privacy" while selling your data to 847 partners.</p>
      
      <p>Privacy isn't dead. It's just being held hostage by surveillance capitalism. But we have a weapon: <strong>GDPR</strong>—the only regulation that makes data brokers sweat.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ILLUMINATION: If you're not paying for it, you're the product. If you are paying for it, you're probably still the product. Question everything.</em></p>
      
      <p>Here's our anarchist approach to data protection, grounded in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Privacy_Policy.md">actual GDPR compliance</a>:</p>

    <section id="five-principles">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Principles of Not Being a Data Vampire</h2>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. Purpose Limitation</h3>
          <p>Collect data for <strong>specific purposes</strong>, not "whatever we might want later." Mission creep is how surveillance states are born.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>If you can't articulate why you need data, you don't need it.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. Data Minimization</h3>
          <p>Collect only what you need. Every byte is a liability, a target, and a responsibility. More data ≠ better insights. Usually just more risk.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>The best data to protect is data you never collected.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. Storage Limitation</h3>
          <p>Delete data when you're done with it. Hoarding data "just in case" is how breaches become catastrophes. Set retention periods, enforce them.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Data is toxic waste—dispose of it properly or it poisons everything.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. Transparency</h3>
          <p>Tell people what you're doing with their data. In plain language, not legalese. Radical transparency isn't just security—it's respect.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>If your privacy policy requires a law degree to understand, it's designed to hide something.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. User Control</h3>
          <p>Give users rights: access, correction, deletion, portability. They own their data, not you. Act accordingly or face GDPR fines that actually hurt.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>User rights aren't optional features—they're legal requirements backed by penalties that matter.</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <section id="privacy-by-design">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Privacy by Design, Not by Accident</h2>
      
      <p>Privacy isn't something you bolt on after building surveillance infrastructure. It's <strong>architectural</strong>:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Default to Privacy</strong> — Opt-in, not opt-out. Make the secure choice the default choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypt Everything</strong> — Data in transit, data at rest, data in use. If it's not encrypted, assume it's already compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimize Attack Surface</strong> — Fewer databases, fewer copies, fewer access points. Simple is survivable.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymize When Possible</strong> — You can't leak PII you don't have. Aggregate, anonymize, pseudonymize.</li>
        <li><strong>Audit Access</strong> — Log who accessed what, when. Trust, but verify. Mostly verify.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>META-ILLUMINATION: Privacy by default means users don't have to trust you—your architecture protects them whether they understand it or not.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="gdpr-weapon">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">GDPR: The Only Regulation With Teeth</h2>
      
      <p>GDPR isn't perfect, but it's the closest thing we have to a weapon against surveillance capitalism:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real Penalties</strong> — Up to 4% of global revenue or €20M, whichever is higher. Companies actually care about this.</li>
        <li><strong>Extraterritorial Reach</strong> — EU citizens' data is protected everywhere. Can't hide in another jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><strong>User Rights</strong> — Right to access, rectification, erasure, data portability. With enforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Breach Notification</strong> — 72 hours to report. No hiding breaches for months/years anymore.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy by Design</strong> — Baked into the regulation. Not optional.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Operation Mindfuck the data brokers:</strong> Exercise your GDPR rights. Request your data. Delete it. Make them work for it. Every request costs them time and money.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>CHAOS ILLUMINATION: The best way to fight surveillance capitalism is to make it economically unviable. GDPR is a start.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="implementation">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Our Implementation: Transparent, Minimal, User-Controlled</h2>
      
      <p>At Hack23, we practice what we preach:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimal Collection</strong> — We collect what we need for services, nothing more.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Purpose</strong> — Every data point has a documented purpose. No "future use" hoarding.</li>
        <li><strong>User Control</strong> — Access, export, delete—your rights, our responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption Everywhere</strong> — Transit, rest, backups. All encrypted.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Tracking</strong> — No analytics that track users across sites. No ad networks. No data brokers.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention Policies</strong> — Data deleted when purpose expires. Automated, enforced, audited.</li>
        <li><strong>Breach Response</strong> — 72-hour notification plan. Because law requires it and users deserve it.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: Privacy Edition</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Except non-consensual data collection—that's expensive now.</p>
      
      <p>Privacy is possible. Not easy, not convenient, but possible. GDPR proved companies can function without selling user souls to the highest bidder.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Read privacy policies. Exercise your rights. Make surveillance capitalism unprofitable.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION: You are now in Chapel Perilous. Privacy is both a right and a responsibility. Both are true. Nothing is true.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong></p>
      
      <p><em>"Think for yourself, schmuck! Question everything—especially anyone who claims to 'value your privacy' while monetizing your data."</em></p>
