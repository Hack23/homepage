   - Media landscapes differ (DR, YLE, NRK)
   - Political party systems require country-specific knowledge

3. **Brand Quality**
   - Professional cybersecurity consulting brand
   - Technical inaccuracies could damage credibility
   - Cultural missteps could alienate target audiences

## Professional Recommendation

### ⚠️ This Task Requires Professional Translation Resources

**Why UI Enhancement Specialist Role is Insufficient**:
- ✅ Can provide: Technical HTML framework, structure, validation
- ❌ Cannot provide: Native fluency in DA/FI/NO languages
- ❌ Cannot provide: Nordic cybersecurity terminology expertise
- ❌ Cannot provide: Cultural knowledge of Nordic political systems
- ❌ Cannot provide: 96-126 hours of professional translation work

**Option 2: Native Speaker Security Professionals**
