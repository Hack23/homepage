            <h1>Mobile Device Management: BYOD Means Bring Your Own Disaster</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Your phone bypasses the firewall."</em></p>

            <h2>📱 The Problem: Phones Are Computers</h2>
            
            <p>Mobile devices bypass perimeters. They roam networks. They install apps. They get lost. They get stolen. They access company email and then visit malicious websites.</p>
            
            <p><strong>BYOD means "Bring Your Own Disaster."</strong> Personal phones accessing corporate data. Unmanaged devices on corporate networks. Shadow IT in everyone's pocket.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> BYOD means "Bring Your Own Disaster." Manage it or suffer it. Unmanaged mobile devices are uncontrolled corporate access.
            </div>

            <h2>🛡️ The Five MDM Controls</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Device Enrollment</h3>
                    <p><strong>Register before access.</strong></p>
                    <p>No corporate access without MDM enrollment. Inventory all devices. Know what's connecting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Policy Enforcement</h3>
                    <p><strong>Require passcodes, encryption, updates.</strong></p>
                    <p>Enforce minimum security settings. Block jailbroken devices. Require OS updates.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. App Management</h3>
                    <p><strong>Control what apps can access what data.</strong></p>
                    <p>Whitelist approved apps. Blacklist dangerous apps. Containerize corporate data.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Remote Wipe</h3>
                    <p><strong>Lost device? Delete corporate data.</strong></p>
                    <p>Selective wipe removes corporate data. Full wipe resets device. Both are necessary capabilities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Monitoring</h3>
                    <p><strong>Track compliance, detect anomalies.</strong></p>
                    <p>Monitor for policy violations. Detect compromised devices. Alert on suspicious behavior.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> Mobile devices are computers that bypass your firewall, install untrusted apps, and get left in taxis. Manage them or accept constant breaches.
            </div>

            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            
            <p>Our MDM strategy is public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MDM enrollment required</strong> - No enrollment, no corporate email</li>
                <li><strong>Containerization</strong> - Corporate data in managed container</li>
                <li><strong>Policy enforcement</strong> - Passcode, encryption, OS updates required</li>
                <li><strong>App whitelisting</strong> - Approved apps only for corporate data</li>
                <li><strong>Remote wipe capability</strong> - Lost/stolen devices wiped immediately</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Perfect mobile security is corporate-owned devices with full control. Reality is BYOD with containerization. Compromise or deny access.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Manage or Suffer</h2>
            
            <p>Mobile devices aren't going away. BYOD isn't optional. <strong>Manage devices or accept that unmanaged devices are accessing corporate systems.</strong></p>
            
            <p>MDM isn't perfect control—it's risk reduction. Enforce minimum security. Containerize corporate data. Enable remote wipe. Or find out the hard way when devices get compromised.</p>
