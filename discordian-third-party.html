            <h1>Third-Party Management: Trust Your Vendors? (LOL)</h1>
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Their breach is your breach."</em></p>
            <h2>🤝 The Problem: Your Vendors Are Your Weakest Link</h2>
            <p>Your vendors' security is your security. <strong>Their breach is your breach.</strong> Target breached through HVAC vendor. Equifax breached through Apache Struts. Your most secure system is compromised through the vendor you forgot to audit.</p>
            <div class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Your most secure system is compromised through the vendor you forgot to audit. Third-party risk is supply chain risk is your risk.</div>
            <h2>🛡️ The Five Vendor Management Steps</h2>
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card"><h3>1. Due Diligence</h3><p><strong>Assess before contracting.</strong></p><p>Security questionnaires, SOC 2 reports, penetration test results. Trust but verify—actually just verify.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>2. Contracts</h3><p><strong>Security requirements in writing.</strong></p><p>Data Processing Agreements, breach notification, audit rights. Contracts protect when things fail.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>3. Monitoring</h3><p><strong>Continuous oversight.</strong></p><p>Regular audits, security updates, incident reports. Vendors' security posture changes—monitor it.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>4. Incident Response</h3><p><strong>Plan for vendor breaches.</strong></p><p>What if vendor compromised? How to detect? How to respond? Plan before breach, not during.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>5. Exit Strategy</h3><p><strong>How to leave?</strong></p><p>Data retrieval, deletion verification, service migration. Vendor lock-in is risk—plan exit.</p></div>
            </div>
            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            <p>Our vendor management is public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security assessments</strong> - Before contracting, review security posture</li>
                <li><strong>DPAs required</strong> - Data Processing Agreements for all data processors</li>
                <li><strong>Annual reviews</strong> - Reassess critical vendors yearly</li>
                <li><strong>Breach notifications</strong> - Contractual requirement for 24-hour notification</li>
                <li><strong>Exit plans</strong> - Documented migration procedures for critical vendors</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Trust your vendors? Maybe. Verify your vendors? Always. Audit your vendors? Annually. Plan for vendor breaches? Constantly.</div>
            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Verify or Regret</h2>
            <p>Your vendors process your data. Access your systems. <strong>Their security is your security.</strong> Assess before contracting. Monitor continuously. Plan for breaches. Or find out the hard way that vendor security was theoretical.</p>
