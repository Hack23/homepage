    <section id="intro">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">AWS-Native Recovery: When (Not If) Everything Burns</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including complete infrastructure failure. The question isn't "if"—it's "when" and "how fast can you recover?"</p>
      
      <p><em>Think for yourself. Question authority.</em> Question disaster recovery plans that have never been tested. Question "backup strategies" without actual restore validation. Question RTO/RPO targets without chaos engineering proof.</p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, disaster recovery isn't hypothetical documentation—it's <strong>continuously validated through automated chaos engineering</strong> using AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS). We don't trust our recovery capabilities. <strong>We prove them monthly with deliberate infrastructure failures.</strong> All recovery objectives are validated through AWS Resilience Hub deployment gating and FIS experiment evidence.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ILLUMINATION: Untested DR plans are fiction dressed as policy. We inject chaos monthly—terminating databases, breaking networks, deleting volumes—to prove our recovery automation works. Evidence over hope.</em></p>
      
      <p>Our approach combines AWS-native resilience tooling (Resilience Hub, FIS, Backup) with systematic chaos engineering and automated recovery validation. This demonstrates cybersecurity consulting expertise through measurable recovery capabilities with auditable proof. Full technical details in our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Disaster_Recovery_Plan.md">public Disaster Recovery Plan</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Deployment Gating:</strong> AWS Resilience Hub assesses application resilience before production deployment. Applications failing RTO/RPO compliance thresholds are blocked from deployment until resilience requirements are met. This ensures disaster recovery capabilities are architectural requirements, not operational afterthoughts.</p>

      <p><strong>We don't trust—we verify.</strong> Monthly FIS experiments deliberately inject failures to validate recovery automation:</p>
      
      <p><strong>🔴 Critical System Experiments (Monthly):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Database Disaster:</strong> RDS primary instance termination → validates automatic failover to read replica &lt; 5 min</li>
        <li><strong>API Unavailability:</strong> 100% Lambda error rate injection → validates circuit breaker activation and graceful degradation</li>
        <li><strong>Network Partition:</strong> VPC subnet isolation → validates cross-AZ redundancy and connection retry logic</li>
        <li><strong>Regional Impairment:</strong> DNS resolution failure → validates Route 53 health check failover to backup region</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>🟠 High Priority Experiments (Quarterly):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage Outage:</strong> EBS volume unavailability → validates backup volume mount and data recovery</li>
        <li><strong>CDN Degradation:</strong> CloudFront cache invalidation → validates origin server direct access</li>
        <li><strong>Compute Failure:</strong> EC2 instance termination → validates Auto Scaling group replacement</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Evidence Collection:</strong> Every FIS experiment generates timestamped logs (CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, RDS events, Route 53 health checks). Experiment artifacts prove actual recovery time vs. RTO target. Failures trigger incident response and architectural remediation.</p>

    <section id="implementation">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Our Approach: Automated Recovery Through AWS-Native Tooling</h2>
      
      <p>At Hack23, disaster recovery is systematic implementation leveraging AWS managed services:</p>
      
      <p><strong>🔰 AWS Resilience Hub Policy Enforcement:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resilience Policies:</strong> Define RTO/RPO requirements per application tier mapped to <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md">Classification Framework</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Assessment:</strong> Continuous resilience analysis identifies gaps, missing redundancy, single points of failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment Gating:</strong> Production releases require "GREEN" Resilience Hub assessment status.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence Documentation:</strong> Audit trail of resilience assessments, remediation actions, compliance validation.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>🧪 AWS Fault Injection Service Integration:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Experiment Templates:</strong> Pre-configured chaos scenarios (instance termination, API throttling, network blackhole).</li>
        <li><strong>SSM Automation:</strong> FIS experiments trigger AWS Systems Manager documents for complex failure scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Safeguards:</strong> CloudWatch alarm integration stops experiments if critical thresholds breached.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Automated verification of recovery time vs. RTO target with pass/fail criteria.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>💾 AWS Backup Orchestration:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Central Backup Plans:</strong> Automated scheduling (hourly/daily/weekly) per data classification tier.</li>
        <li><strong>Immutable Vaults:</strong> Vault lock prevents backup deletion for ransomware protection. Cross-region replication to separate AWS account.</li>
        <li><strong>Point-in-Time Recovery:</strong> Continuous backups enable restoration to any point within retention window.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup Audit Manager:</strong> Compliance reporting validates backup coverage, retention policies, restore testing.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>☁️ Multi-Region Resilience Architecture:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Route 53 Health Checks:</strong> Automated DNS failover when primary region health checks fail.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-AZ Deployment:</strong> Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB deployed across availability zones for automatic failover.</li>
        <li><strong>S3 Cross-Region Replication:</strong> Critical data replicated asynchronously for regional disaster recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>CloudFormation StackSets:</strong> Infrastructure-as-code deployed identically across regions for consistent recovery.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: Chaos As Resilience Strategy</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including your infrastructure completely failing. The only question is whether you've proven you can recover.</p>
      
      <p>Most organizations write disaster recovery plans, file them in SharePoint, and hope they never need them. They talk about RTO/RPO targets. They mention "high availability." They claim "redundant architecture." None of it is tested. None of it is proven. It's aspirational documentation disguised as operational capability.</p>
      
      <p>We weaponize chaos. <strong>Monthly FIS experiments</strong> deliberately terminate databases, inject API errors, break network connections. <strong>AWS Resilience Hub gates</strong> block production deployments that don't meet RTO/RPO requirements. <strong>Immutable cross-region backups</strong> protect against ransomware. This isn't theory—it's continuously validated operational resilience.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Question DR plans never tested. Question RTO targets without automation to meet them. Question "disaster recovery" that's really "disaster hope." (Spoiler: Hope isn't a strategy.)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Our competitive advantage:</strong> We demonstrate cybersecurity consulting expertise through provable recovery capabilities. &lt;5 min RTO for critical systems with monthly chaos validation. Resilience Hub deployment gating. Public DR documentation with FIS experiment evidence. This isn't DR theater—it's operational proof.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION: You are now in Chapel Perilous. You can continue hoping your untested DR plan works. Or you can deliberately break your infrastructure monthly to prove your recovery automation works. Your systems. Your choice. Choose evidence over hope.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong></p>
      
      <p><em>"Think for yourself, schmuck! Untested disaster recovery is disaster theater. We inject chaos monthly to prove recovery works."</em></p>
