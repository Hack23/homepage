    <section id="introduction">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Demonstrating Security Excellence Through Public Evidence</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> When vendors say "trust our security," demand evidence. When they say "proprietary algorithms protect our intellectual property," hear "we can't show you the backdoors." At Hack23, we provide public evidence through OpenSSF Scorecard (≥7.0), SLSA Level 3 attestations, CII Best Practices badges, and SonarCloud quality gates. <em>Not marketing claims—automated evidence updated continuously by robots that don't care about quarterly earnings.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including verifying our security claims yourself, auditing our source code line-by-line, forking our repositories, and proving we're full of shit if we are (spoiler: we're not, but you should verify anyway because trust without verification is faith and faith gets you breached). Every repository has public badges demonstrating continuous security validation. Not marketing claims nobody can verify—automated evidence anyone can audit. <strong>The difference between "trust us" and "verify us" is the difference between religion and science.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Open_Source_Policy.md">Open Source Policy</a> isn't philosophy—it's systematic security implementation with measurable outcomes. All Hack23 repositories maintain SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md (current state), FUTURE_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md (roadmap), SECURITY.md (vulnerability disclosure), and WORKFLOWS.md (CI/CD documentation). This demonstrates cybersecurity consulting expertise through transparent implementation.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: "Trust me" is what vendors without evidence say. "Here's the badge showing OpenSSF Scorecard 7.2" is what confidence looks like. Choose verifiable evidence over marketing.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Pillars of Public Security Evidence</h2>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. 🏆 OpenSSF Scorecard ≥7.0</h3>
          <p><strong>Supply chain security assessment.</strong> Automated evaluation of security practices: code review, CI tests, SAST, vulnerability handling, dependency updates, branch protection, token permissions. Score ≥7.0 demonstrates mature security processes.</p>
          <p><strong>Live evidence:</strong> <a href="https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Hack23/cia">CIA: 7.2</a> | <a href="https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Hack23/blacktrigram">Black Trigram</a> | <a href="https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager">CIA Compliance Manager</a></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: OpenSSF Scorecard can't be gamed. It checks actual practices, not marketing claims. 7.0+ means systematic security, not security theater.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. 🔒 SLSA Level 3 Build Provenance</h3>
          <p><strong>Supply chain integrity attestation.</strong> Cryptographically signed build attestations proving artifacts weren't tampered with. SLSA Level 3 requires non-falsifiable provenance, hermetic builds, and verified source-to-binary mapping.</p>
          <p><strong>Verification:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/attestations">CIA attestations</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/blacktrigram/attestations">Black Trigram attestations</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager/attestations">CIA CM attestations</a></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: SLSA Level 3 means we can prove the binaries you download came from our source code. No substitution attacks. No tampering. Cryptographically verified.</em></p>

        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. ✅ CII Best Practices (Passing+)</h3>
          <p><strong>Open source security maturity.</strong> Core Infrastructure Initiative badge requires documentation, testing, security response, quality standards. "Passing" level demonstrates baseline excellence. Our projects achieve this through systematic practices, not checkbox compliance.</p>
          <p><strong>Badge status:</strong> <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/770">CIA: Passing</a> | <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/10777">Black Trigram: Passing</a> | <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/10365">CIA CM: Passing</a></p>

        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. 📊 SonarCloud Quality Gates (Passed)</h3>
          <p><strong>Code quality and security validation.</strong> Automated SAST scanning on every commit. Quality gate enforces: zero high/critical vulnerabilities, &lt;3% duplication, ≥80% coverage, security hotspots reviewed. Our projects maintain "Passed" status through continuous quality enforcement.</p>
          <p><strong>Quality status:</strong> <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Hack23_cia">CIA</a> | <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Hack23_blacktrigram">Black Trigram</a> | <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Hack23_cia-compliance-manager">CIA CM</a></p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Quality gates that actually gate. Failed build = no merge. No exceptions. No "we'll fix it later." Quality now or no deployment.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. ⚖️ FOSSA License Compliance</h3>
          <p><strong>Automated license scanning.</strong> Continuous monitoring of all dependencies for license compliance. FOSSA generates SBOM (Software Bill of Materials), identifies license conflicts, ensures only approved licenses. Public badge means automated compliance, not manual audits that get stale.</p>
          <p><strong>Compliance status:</strong> <a href="https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FHack23%2Fcia">CIA</a> | <a href="https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FHack23%2Fblacktrigram">Black Trigram</a> | <a href="https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FHack23%2Fcia-compliance-manager">CIA CM</a></p>

    <section id="our-approach">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Radical Transparency: Everything Open by Default</h2>
      
      <p><strong>At Hack23, transparency isn't philosophy—it's competitive advantage through demonstrable security excellence:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>All Projects Public:</strong> Every repository at <a href="https://github.com/Hack23">github.com/Hack23</a> demonstrates our security practices in executable form. Clients can verify our capabilities before engagement. Competitors can audit our claims (they won't find bullshit). Researchers can study our implementations. <em>This is confidence, not naivete.</em></li>
        <li><strong>All Policies Public:</strong> Complete ISMS at <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC">ISMS-PUBLIC</a>. 33 policy documents. Zero proprietary security magic. Radical transparency builds trust because trust without evidence is just another word for gullible. <strong>We don't sell security through hope—we prove it through documentation.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>All Badges Public:</strong> OpenSSF Scorecard, SLSA, CII, SonarCloud, FOSSA—automated evidence, not quarterly audit theater. These badges update continuously. They can't be gamed without committing fraud publicly. <em>Try lying when the robots are watching and reporting real-time.</em></li>
        <li><strong>All Architecture Public:</strong> SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md with Mermaid diagrams in every repo. Non-technical audiences get dedicated documentation portals. <strong>Security through transparency beats security through hoping attackers don't figure out your architecture (spoiler: they already did).</strong></li>
        <li><strong>All Vulnerabilities Public:</strong> Security advisories, CVE disclosures, incident post-mortems (sanitized for privacy, not sanitized for ego). Learn from our findings. <em>Hiding vulnerabilities protects pride, not systems. Public disclosure protects users.</em></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Why this works when conventional wisdom says it shouldn't:</strong> Attackers already have tools to analyze your systems—decompilers, debuggers, fuzzing frameworks, static analyzers, network scanners. Hiding architecture from users doesn't hide it from attackers—it just prevents your users from understanding security and making informed decisions. <strong>We choose transparency over security through obscurity.</strong> They can see our defenses? Good. That means everyone can verify they actually work. That's called confidence. Hiding your defenses means either they don't work or you don't want audit trails when they fail.</p>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris!</strong> Chaos teaches: hiding your code prevents defense, not attacks. Public code enables community security review. Private code enables only vendor review (which vendors skip when deadlines loom).</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>The security-industrial complex sells "proprietary threat intelligence" about vulnerabilities everyone could already see if code were public. Transparency destroys their business model. That's feature, not bug. Question who benefits from code secrecy.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: Open Source as Competitive Advantage</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including verifying that Hack23's security claims are backed by public evidence updated continuously by robots immune to quarterly earnings pressure. OpenSSF Scorecard ≥7.0. SLSA Level 3. CII Best Practices. SonarCloud quality gates passed. FOSSA license compliance. All visible. All automated. All verifiable. <em>This is what security confidence looks like when you're not selling snake oil.</em></p>
      
      <p>Most security vendors hide behind proprietary code and NDAs. They say "trust us." <strong>We say "verify us"—and provide the badges, documentation, and public repositories to do so.</strong> This isn't naive transparency. This is <strong>competitive advantage through demonstrable expertise</strong>. When your security actually works, you want everyone to see it. When your security is theater, you hide it behind "proprietary technology" (i.e., "please don't look too closely at our security through hope and prayer").</p>
      
      <p><strong>Our open source approach:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Five Public Security Badges</strong> per repository (OpenSSF, SLSA, CII, SonarCloud, FOSSA)—not annual audits, continuous automated validation</li>
        <li><strong>Mandatory Security Documentation</strong> (SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md, THREAT_MODEL.md, SECURITY.md, WORKFLOWS.md)—living documents, not dusty PDFs from 2019</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Evidence Generation</strong> (badges update continuously on every commit, not quarterly after "audit prep sprints")</li>
        <li><strong>Supply Chain Transparency</strong> (SBOM generation, dependency scanning, build provenance with cryptographic attestations)</li>
        <li><strong>Public ISMS</strong> (33 policy documents demonstrating systematic security management, not compliance theater)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Question vendors who say "our security is proprietary." Ask why attackers can't reverse engineer their binaries (they can and do). Ask why transparency threatens their security (it doesn't—it threatens their marketing). <strong>Choose vendors who show their work like they're solving math problems, not vendors who say "trust the magic" like they're selling mystical bullshit.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>You are now in Chapel Perilous. Security through obscurity relies on attacker laziness and incompetence. Security through transparency relies on mathematical proof and community vigilance. Attackers aren't lazy—they're industrious, well-funded, and patient. Communities scale infinitely when motivated. Choose infinite scaling (transparency + open source) over hopeful obscurity (proprietary + NDAs). One approach survives contact with reality. The other survives until the first motivated attacker.</em></p>
