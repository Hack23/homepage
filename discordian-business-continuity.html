            <h1>Business Continuity: Survive the Chaos</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Disasters happen anyway."</em></p>

            <h2>🏢 The Problem: Business Stops When Systems Stop</h2>
            
            <p>Disasters happen. Servers fail. Data centers burn. Pandemics close offices. <strong>Business continuity is planning to survive when everything goes wrong.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Disaster recovery focuses on IT. Business continuity focuses on business. Both required.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Business continuity plans that haven't been tested are just expensive fiction. Test annually or find out during real disaster that your plan was fantasy.
            </div>

            <h2>🛡️ The Five BCP Elements</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Risk Assessment</h3>
                    <p><strong>What can disrupt business?</strong></p>
                    <p>Natural disasters, cyber attacks, pandemics, supply chain failures. Identify threats, assess likelihood.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Business Impact Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>What functions are critical?</strong></p>
                    <p>Revenue generation, customer service, payroll. Define RTO/RPO for business functions, not just IT.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. Recovery Strategies</h3>
                    <p><strong>How to continue operations?</strong></p>
                    <p>Alternate locations, work-from-home, manual processes. Plan multiple scenarios.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Plan Development</h3>
                    <p><strong>Document procedures.</strong></p>
                    <p>Contact lists, decision trees, escalation paths. Plans that exist only in someone's head aren't plans.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Testing & Maintenance</h3>
                    <p><strong>Test regularly, update continuously.</strong></p>
                    <p>Table-top exercises, full simulations. Untested plans don't work. Update when business changes.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> The disaster you didn't plan for is the one that happens. Plan for multiple scenarios—fire, flood, cyber, pandemic—or accept unplanned chaos.
            </div>

            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            
            <p>Our BCP is public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Annual risk assessment</strong> - Identify business disruption threats</li>
                <li><strong>Business impact analysis</strong> - RTO/RPO for critical functions</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery strategies</strong> - Work-from-home, cloud failover, alternate sites</li>
                <li><strong>Documented plans</strong> - Accessible to all staff, updated quarterly</li>
                <li><strong>Annual testing</strong> - Table-top exercises, lessons learned</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Business continuity isn't about preventing disasters—it's about surviving them. Prepare or perish. Test or discover your plan was theoretical.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Survive or Fail</h2>
            
            <p>Disasters happen. <strong>Business continuity is planning to survive when they do.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Assess risks. Analyze impact. Plan recovery. Document procedures. Test regularly. Or find out during actual disaster that survival wasn't planned.</p>
