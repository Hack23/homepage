      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including complete AWS region failures (they happen), crypto-ransomware encrypting everything (daily occurrence somewhere), and pandemics closing offices (remember 2020? that wasn't hypothetical). What separates survivors from statistics is <strong>systematic preparation over hopeful improvisation.</strong> <em>Are you paranoid enough to plan for disasters? Good. Now test the plan quarterly or it's just expensive fiction that provides comfort but not capability. Untested DR plans are Schrödinger's preparedness—both adequate and useless until disaster observes them.</em></p>
      
      <p><em>Think for yourself, schmuck! Question authority.</em> Question why everyone else accepts "we'll figure it out during the crisis" (panic-driven improvisation) while we have classified recovery targets with measurable SLAs and documented test results. <em>Hope is not a strategy. Panic is not a plan. Testing is both.</em> Most BCP documents exist to satisfy auditors, not survive disasters. <strong>When did you last test yours? We test ours quarterly—because the alternative is discovering during actual disasters that your plan assumed infrastructure that no longer exists.</strong></p>
      
      <p>At Hack23, business continuity isn't hope—it's <strong>classification-driven systematic recovery planning.</strong> Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md">CIA+ Classification Framework</a> defines recovery priorities: <strong>RTO &lt;1 hour for critical systems</strong> (€10K+ daily loss, complete outage), <strong>RTO 1-4 hours for high-priority</strong> (€5-10K daily loss), <strong>RPO 1 hour for all production systems</strong> with AWS automated snapshots.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ILLUMINATION: Business continuity plans untested are expensive fiction. We test quarterly with documented recovery time actuals. Average critical system recovery: 47 minutes. Because systematic preparation beats improvisation every time. Most BCPs gather dust until the disaster, then everyone discovers that the recovery runbook assumes infrastructure that no longer exists. FNORD.</em></p>
      
      <p>Our BCP demonstrates cybersecurity consulting expertise through measurable resilience outcomes: multi-region AWS architecture, automated failover, continuous backup validation.

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: BCP Edition</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including complete infrastructure failures, ransomware encryption, and simultaneous multi-system disasters. What separates survivors from statistics is <strong>systematic preparation with tested procedures.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Most organizations discover their BCP is fiction during actual disasters (average: "we'll figure it out as we go"). We test quarterly with measured recovery times: <strong>Critical system recovery average 47 minutes</strong>, High-priority average 3.2 hours, Medium-priority average 18 hours. Not because we're paranoid—because we're prepared.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Our business continuity framework:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Classification-Driven:</strong> Four-level recovery priority tied to business impact (€ daily loss, operational degradation, regulatory risk)</li>
        <li><strong>Specific RTO/RPO:</strong> Critical &lt;1hr/1hr, High 1-4hr/1hr, Medium 4-24hr/4hr, Standard &gt;24hr/24hr</li>
        <li><strong>AWS Multi-Region:</strong> Active-passive across Stockholm/Ireland with automated Route 53 failover</li>
        <li><strong>Tested Procedures:</strong> Quarterly drills with documented actual recovery times vs targets</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Post-test reviews, lessons learned integration, procedure updates</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Question authority—including the assumption that "it won't happen to us." AWS regions fail. Ransomware encrypts. Disasters strike. The only question is whether you'll recover in 47 minutes or 47 days.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>You are now in Chapel Perilous. Business continuity plans untested are business discontinuity guarantees. We test quarterly. We measure recovery times. We learn from every drill. Because survival requires systematic preparation, not hopeful improvisation.</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>All hail Eris! All hail Discordia!</strong></p>
