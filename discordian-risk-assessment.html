            <h1>Risk Assessment: Calculating What You Can't Prevent</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Some things are probable."</em></p>

            <h2>🎲 The Problem: Everything Is Risky</h2>
            
            <p>Risk is what's left after you've done everything you can. <strong>Perfect security doesn't exist.</strong> Zero risk is impossible. Anyone promising zero risk is selling snake oil or ignorance—possibly both.</p>
            
            <p>Risk assessment is honest accounting: What can go wrong? How likely? How bad? What are we doing about it? Did it work?</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Risk is what's left after you've done everything you can. Accepting it is maturity. Ignoring it is negligence. Choose wisely.
            </div>

            <h2>🧮 The Formula: Risk = Likelihood × Impact</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> How often will this happen?<br>
            <strong>Impact:</strong> How bad is it when it does?<br>
            <strong>Risk:</strong> Multiply them together.</p>
            
            <p>High likelihood + low impact = annoying.<br>
            Low likelihood + high impact = catastrophic.<br>
            High likelihood + high impact = fix immediately.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> A 1% chance of losing everything is more dangerous than a 99% chance of losing nothing. Do the math. Then do the mitigation.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 The Five Risk Treatment Options</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Avoid</h3>
                    <p><strong>Don't do the risky thing.</strong></p>
                    <p>Stop using the vulnerable software. Don't store credit cards. Don't connect the nuclear reactor to the internet. Avoidance is absolute.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Mitigate</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reduce likelihood or impact.</strong></p>
                    <p>Patch vulnerabilities (reduce likelihood). Backup data (reduce impact). Most security work is mitigation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. Transfer</h3>
                    <p><strong>Make it someone else's problem.</strong></p>
                    <p>Insurance, outsourcing, contracts. Transfer doesn't eliminate risk—it shifts who pays when things break.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Accept</h3>
                    <p><strong>Acknowledge and document.</strong></p>
                    <p>Some risks aren't worth fixing. Document the decision. Get executive signoff. Accept knowingly, not accidentally.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Ignore</h3>
                    <p><strong>Pretend it doesn't exist.</strong></p>
                    <p>This is not a valid option. But many organizations choose it anyway. Then wonder why they got breached.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Accepting risk consciously is strategy. Accepting risk unconsciously is negligence. Document your choices or they choose for you.
            </div>

            <h2>📊 The Risk Matrix: Visual Lies</h2>
            
            <p>Risk matrices are popular because they're visual. They're also misleading because they're oversimplified.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Standard 5×5 Matrix:</strong><br>
            Likelihood: Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain<br>
            Impact: Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic<br>
            Risk Level: Low, Medium, High, Critical</p>
            
            <p>Looks authoritative. Actually subjective. "Possible" to one person is "Likely" to another. "Major impact" depends on who you ask.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Use risk matrices for communication, not precision.</strong> Actual risk requires actual numbers—probability distributions, cost estimates, and math that makes executives uncomfortable.</p>

            <h2>🔄 The Risk Assessment Cycle</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify</strong> - What assets? What threats? What vulnerabilities?</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze</strong> - Likelihood? Impact? Risk level?</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> - Above risk appetite? Requires treatment?</li>
                <li><strong>Treat</strong> - Avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept?</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor</strong> - Did it work? Did risks change?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Risk assessment isn't annual theater—it's continuous process. New threats emerge. Old controls fail. Reassess quarterly or when significant changes occur.</p>

            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            
            <p>Our risk assessment methodology is public (of course): <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Risk_Assessment_Methodology.md" target="_blank">Risk Assessment Methodology</a></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset inventory</strong> - Can't assess risk to assets you don't know exist</li>
                <li><strong>Threat modeling</strong> - Who wants to attack? Why? How?</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability assessment</strong> - What's exploitable?</li>
                <li><strong>Risk calculation</strong> - Likelihood × Impact with actual numbers</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment plans</strong> - Documented decisions with executive approval</li>
                <li><strong>Quarterly reviews</strong> - Risks change, assessments follow</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Risk assessment without action is expensive documentation. Assessment → Treatment → Monitoring → Reassessment. The cycle never ends.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Accept or Act</h2>
            
            <p>You can't eliminate all risk. You can't prevent all attacks. You can't afford perfect security—nobody can.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Risk assessment is honest accounting.</strong> What can go wrong? How likely? How bad? What are we doing? Is it working?</p>
            
            <p>Identify, analyze, evaluate, treat, monitor. Accept risk knowingly or mitigate it effectively. But don't ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist.</p>
            
            <p>That's not risk management. That's negligence with extra steps.</p>
