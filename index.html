			<li>
			  <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia">Citizen Intelligence Agency</a> - A volunteer-driven, open-source intelligence (OSINT) project that provides a neutral and comprehensive dashboard focusing on political activity in Sweden. By monitoring key political figures and institutions, the platform offers valuable insights into financial performance, risk metrics, and political trends. Additionally, the dashboard features a ranking system, enabling users to objectively compare politicians based on performance. The Citizen Intelligence Agency seeks to encourage informed decision-making, enhance transparency in governance, and cultivate an engaged and well-informed citizenry. The initiative is independent and non-partisan, utilizing data, metadata, and charts related to the Swedish Parliament and government, encompassing parliament members, committees, documents, ballots, decisions, ministries, government members, and political parties. The project relies on open data from various sources such as:
			  <ul>
			    <li><a href="http://data.riksdagen.se/">Swedish Parliament Open Data</a> - Offers a wide range of data related to the Swedish Parliament, including members, committees, and documents.</li>
			    <li><a href="http://www.val.se/">Swedish Election Authority</a> - Provides information on election processes, results, and political parties in Sweden.</li>
			    <li><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank Open Data</a> - Contains global development data, including economic indicators and demographic information.</li>
			    <li><a href="https://www.esv.se/statistik-och-data/psidata/">Swedish National Financial Management Authority (ESV) Public Sector Information (PSI) Data</a> - Offers data on government finances, economic trends, and public sector operations in Sweden.</li>
