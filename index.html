	  <h2>About James Pether Sörling</h2>
	  Experienced technology professional with expertise in information security and delivery of secure cloud systems. Strong advocate for transparency in organizations and committed to ensuring the security and reliability of my open source projects through the use of industry best practices such as OpenSSF and CII Best Practices.
	  
	  <p>James Sörling, a security professional and open source contributor, gave a talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_hq2Y03d6I">Javaforum Göteborg</a> where he discussed how to secure your development pipeline with static and dynamic application security tests, as well as software composition analysis using Sonarqube.</p>
<p>In addition, Sörling was a guest on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYwSd1Wu28Q&ab_channel=Soluble/">Shift Left Like A Boss</a> security podcast, where he discussed open source tools that can make high velocity development more secure. As an open source contributor for cfn-nag, which performs infrastructure as code (IaC) static analysis of AWS CloudFormation, he also wrote an open source module that integrates CFN-nag into SonarQube. This allows developers, DevOps, and SREs to scan their CloudFormation during development to help fix issues early and to associate owners to IaC early in development, which aids in audit and compliance.</p>

		<h2>Past Projects</h2>

			<li>
			  <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia">Citizen Intelligence Agency</a> - An open-source intelligence (OSINT) project that tracks politicians in Sweden using Statistical Machine Intelligence and Learning Engine and Business Rules Management System. The project is independent and non-partisan, developed as a voluntary effort. The goal of the project is to visualize political activity in Sweden, present key performance indicators and metadata for the actors on a national level. The application displays data, metadata, and charts related to Swedish parliament and government, covering parliament members, committees, documents, ballots, decisions, ministries, government members, and political parties. The project uses open data from various sources such as <a href="http://data.riksdagen.se/">http://data.riksdagen.se/</a>, <a href="http://www.val.se/">http://www.val.se/</a>, and <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">http://data.worldbank.org/</a>.

			  <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/sonar-cloudformation-plugin">Sonar-CloudFormation-Plugin</a> - A plugin for <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> that allows users to analyze <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> templates written in YAML or JSON, developed in Java. The plugin uses the SonarQube API to perform code analysis on the templates and generate detailed reports on best practices, potential security issues, and other code quality metrics. The plugin integrates with <a href="https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag">cfn-nag</a> and <a href="https://www.checkov.io/">Checkov</a> to provide additional security checks based on the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/">CWE</a>, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST 800-53</a>, and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html">ISO 27001</a> standards.

			  <li>
			    <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/lambda-in-private-vpc">Lambda in Private VPC</a> - POC of multi-region active/active site with Resilience Hub policy compliance and runbooks for fast recovery from failures. </li>
			</ul>
			<p> This project focuses on Resilience Hub policy compliance and runbooks to ensure fast recovery from failures. It features a Lambda function running in a private VPC with multi-region active/active site setup, with RTO/RPO of 5 min for application, AZ, and region failures. The project includes fault injections to test SOP and follows a zero trust model with an API Gateway for schema request validation and cross-region replicated DynamoDB. Route53 geolocation DNS setup and CloudFront failover S3 bucket in a different region for frontend. The project also includes badges for license and OpenSSF Scorecard. </p>    </div>
