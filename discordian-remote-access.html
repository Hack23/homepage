              <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> VPNs don't make traffic secure—encryption does. VPNs just move the trust boundary. Zero trust for remote users or accept that compromised home networks compromise corporate access.</p>
              
              <p>At Hack23, remote access isn't "work from home policy"—it's <strong>zero trust architecture</strong> integrated into our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md">Access Control Policy</a> with MFA enforcement, Identity Center SSO, and classification-based session timeouts: 1-hour for financial systems (Very High), 4-hour for cloud core infrastructure (Extreme), 8-hour for development pipeline (High).</p>
              
              <p>Remote access controls documented in our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md">public Access Control Policy</a>—because security through obscurity means attackers know your weaknesses better than you do.

              <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Remote Access Controls That Actually Work</h2>
              
              <div class="cards">
                <div class="card confidentiality-card">
                  <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
                  <h3>1. 🔐 Multi-Factor Authentication (Universal)</h3>
                  <p><strong>Passwords alone aren't enough.</strong> MFA for all remote access. No exceptions. Phished passwords are useless without second factor. Hardware security keys (FIDO2) for Extreme/Very High, TOTP for High/Moderate, platform MFA minimum for Public.</p>
                  <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> AWS Identity Center enforces MFA via primary identity provider. GitHub requires TOTP. Banking uses provider-issued tokens. Social platforms use native MFA.</p>
                  <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Passwords + phishing = compromise. Passwords + MFA + phishing = failed attack. Math is simple.</em></p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card integrity-card">
                  <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
                  <h3>2. 🖥️ Identity-Centric Access (Not Network-Based)</h3>
                  <p><strong>Verify every request, trust nothing.</strong> No implicit trust based on network location. Remote user = on-premises user = same verification. Identity Center SSO for cloud, platform MFA for development, zero trust for all systems.</p>
                  <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> AWS Identity Center centralized identity. GitHub organization access. No "inside network = trusted" assumptions. Every request authenticated and authorized.</p>
                  <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Network location is not identity. VPN connections don't prove trustworthiness. Verify identity, not IP address.</em></p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card availability-card">
                  <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
                  <h3>3. ⏱️ Session Management (Classification-Based)</h3>
                  <p><strong>Session timeouts prevent token theft.</strong> Extreme assets: 4h timeout. Very High: 1h. High: 8h. Moderate: 24h. Public: 7 days. Shorter timeout = faster stolen token expiration = reduced attack window.</p>
                  <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> IdP enforces session lifetime. Cloud platforms honor IdP session. Re-authentication required after timeout. No "remember me forever" for critical systems.</p>
                  <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Stolen session tokens are time-bombs. Shorter fuses = less damage. Critical systems require fresh authentication frequently.</em></p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card confidentiality-card">
                  <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
                  <h3>4. 📊 Continuous Monitoring (Detect Anomalies)</h3>
                  <p><strong>Log all remote access. Monitor for anomalies.</strong> CloudTrail logs every AWS API call. GitHub logs repository access. Automated alerts on suspicious patterns: impossible travel, unusual access times, privilege escalation attempts.</p>
                  <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> AWS CloudTrail + GuardDuty. GitHub audit logs. Security Hub aggregation. Automated anomaly detection with CEO escalation for critical alerts.</p>
                  <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Detection requires visibility. Visibility requires logging. Logging without monitoring is audit theater. Monitor, alert, respond.</em></p>

                <div class="card integrity-card">
                  <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
                  <h3>5. 🔄 Quarterly Access Reviews (Revoke Stale Access)</h3>
                  <p><strong>Verify who has access to what.</strong> Quarterly privilege reviews per our Access Control Policy. Dormant accounts disabled. Excessive privileges revoked. Access aligned with current roles, not historical permissions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Automated access reports from IdP. Manual review of privileged accounts. Revocation workflow for inactive users. Documentation of review results.</p>
                  <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Access creep is real. Users accumulate permissions over time. Regular reviews prevent privilege sprawl. Revoke what's unused.</em></p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Identity Provider:</strong> Centralized authentication with MFA enforcement</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Identity Center:</strong> SSO + MFA for all AWS accounts via centralized IdP</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Organization:</strong> Platform MFA required, SSH key authentication for repository access</li>

                <li><strong>TOTP Authenticator:</strong> Time-based one-time passwords for High/Moderate assets</li>
                <li><strong>Platform Native MFA:</strong> Service-provided MFA for Public classification</li>
                <li><strong>Backup MFA:</strong> SMS recovery (not primary—SMS vulnerable to SIM swap)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>⏱️ Session Management by Classification:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Extreme (Cloud Core):</strong> 4-hour session timeout, hardware + software MFA</li>
                <li><strong>Very High (Financial):</strong> 1-hour session timeout, hardware + SMS MFA</li>
                <li><strong>High (Development):</strong> 8-hour session timeout, TOTP + SSH keys</li>

                <li><strong>AWS CloudTrail:</strong> Every API call logged, retained 90 days, archived to S3</li>
                <li><strong>AWS GuardDuty:</strong> Threat detection for malicious activity, compromised credentials</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Security Hub:</strong> Centralized security findings aggregation</li>

              <p><strong>🔄 Access Review Schedule:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Quarterly Reviews:</strong> All privileged accounts reviewed by CEO</li>

                <li><strong>Automated Reports:</strong> Dormant accounts, excessive privileges, access violations</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate Revocation:</strong> Terminated employees, contractors, role changes</li>

              <h2 class="panel-caption">Welcome to Chapel Perilous: Remote Access Edition</h2>
              
              <p><strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> The office perimeter is dead. Remote work is permanent. Security models built on physical location assumptions are obsolete—adapt or breach.</p>
              
              <p>Most organizations discover remote compromises months after initial access (average dwell time: 207 days per 2023 data). We prevent remote attacks through <strong>zero trust architecture</strong>: MFA enforcement, Identity Center SSO, classification-based session timeouts, continuous monitoring, quarterly privilege reviews.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Our remote access framework demonstrates consulting expertise:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Universal MFA</strong> — Hardware keys for Extreme/Very High, TOTP for High/Moderate, platform MFA for Public</li>
                <li><strong>Identity-Centric</strong> — AWS Identity Center SSO, GitHub organization MFA, zero network trust</li>
                <li><strong>Session Management</strong> — 1-hour to 7-day timeouts based on classification framework</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong> — CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, GitHub audit logs</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Reviews</strong> — Quarterly privilege reviews, monthly for Extreme/Very High assets</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Question authority—including the assumption that VPNs equal security. VPNs are network tunnels, not authentication. Identity is the new perimeter. Verify every request. Trust nothing, especially not "inside the network."</p>
              
              <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>You are now in Chapel Perilous. Remote work is permanent. Office perimeters are obsolete. Identity-centric security is the only security that scales. Verify identity on every request or accept that remote users are unverified attack vectors. Your infrastructure. Your choice.
