            <h1>Remote Access: VPNs and the Death of the Office</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. The office is optional."</em></p>

            <h2>🏠 The Problem: Remote Work Is Permanent</h2>
            
            <p>Remote work isn't temporary. The office is dead—or at least optional. <strong>Security models built on physical perimeters don't work when everyone works from home.</strong></p>
            
            <p>VPNs don't make traffic secure—encryption does. VPNs just move the trust boundary. Zero trust for remote users or accept that compromised home networks compromise corporate access.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> VPNs don't make traffic secure—encryption does. VPNs just move the trust boundary. Zero trust for remote users or accept remote compromises.
            </div>

            <h2>🔐 The Five Remote Access Controls</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
                    <p><strong>Passwords alone aren't enough.</strong></p>
                    <p>MFA for all remote access. No exceptions. Phished passwords are useless without second factor.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Device Management</h3>
                    <p><strong>Managed devices only.</strong></p>
                    <p>MDM/EDR on all devices. Enforce encryption, updates, antivirus. No unmanaged device access.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. Zero Trust Access</h3>
                    <p><strong>Verify every request.</strong></p>
                    <p>No implicit trust based on network. Verify user, device, context for each access. Trust nothing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. VPN When Necessary</h3>
                    <p><strong>VPN for legacy systems.</strong></p>
                    <p>Modern systems use zero trust. Legacy systems need VPN. Split tunnel for performance. Monitor all connections.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Monitoring & Logging</h3>
                    <p><strong>See who accesses what.</strong></p>
                    <p>Log all remote access. Monitor for anomalies. Alert on suspicious patterns. Detection requires visibility.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> Remote access from coffee shop WiFi on unmanaged devices is asking to be breached. Require managed devices with MFA or accept compromises.
            </div>

            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            
            <p>Our remote access policy is public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a><br>
            <small><em>Note: Remote access controls are covered in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Access_Control_Policy.md" target="_blank">Access Control Policy</a>. No standalone remote access or mobile device management policy exists – controls integrated into access management framework.</em></small></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MFA required</strong> - All remote access requires multi-factor authentication</li>
                <li><strong>Managed devices only</strong> - MDM enrollment required for corporate access</li>
                <li><strong>Zero trust architecture</strong> - Verify every request, trust nothing</li>
                <li><strong>VPN for legacy systems</strong> - Modern apps use zero trust, legacy uses VPN</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous monitoring</strong> - Log all access, alert on anomalies</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> The office perimeter is dead. Remote work is permanent. Security models that assume users are inside a trusted network are obsolete. Adapt or breach.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Zero Trust or Zero Security</h2>
            
            <p>Remote work is permanent. <strong>Security models built on physical perimeters don't work.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Require MFA. Manage devices. Verify every request. Monitor access. Or accept that remote users are unverified, unmanaged, and unmonitored.</p>
            
            <p>The office is optional. Security isn't.</p>
