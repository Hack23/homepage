## ⚠️ Why Professional Translation is Required

### Business Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | AI Translation | Professional Translation |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Quality** | 70-80% accuracy | 95-98% accuracy |
| **Cost** | Lower upfront (hidden review costs) | €7K-€10K clear investment |
| **Effort** | 62-91 hours (more than professional!) | 48-63 hours |
| **Reputation Risk** | HIGH (potential client loss) | LOW (enterprise-grade quality) |
| **Client Value at Risk** | €50K-€200K per lost deal | Protected |
| **Timeline** | Uncertain (extensive corrections) | 2-3 weeks predictable |

### Critical Content Elements

2. **Technical Precision:**
   - ISO 27001 terminology must be professionally accurate
