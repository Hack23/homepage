            <h1>Physical Security: Locks, Guards, and Clever Social Engineering</h1>
            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Physical access = game over."</em></p>
            <h2>🏰 The Problem: Physical Access Bypasses Everything</h2>
            <p>Physical access = game over. <strong>All your crypto is irrelevant when someone walks out with the server.</strong> Firewalls don't stop tailgating. Encryption doesn't stop USB keyloggers. Physical security is foundational—without it, everything else fails.</p>
            <div class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Social engineering bypasses your firewall by walking through the door with a smile. Physical security requires physical vigilance.</div>
            <h2>🛡️ The Five Layers of Physical Security</h2>
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card"><h3>1. Perimeter</h3><p><strong>Fences, gates, monitoring.</strong></p><p>First defense layer. Deters casual intruders. Won't stop determined attackers.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>2. Building</h3><p><strong>Locked doors, guards, cameras.</strong></p><p>Access control at building entry. Badge systems. Security guards. Visitor logs.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>3. Floor</h3><p><strong>Department access controls.</strong></p><p>Not everyone needs access everywhere. Segment by floor, department, role.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>4. Room</h3><p><strong>Server rooms, network closets.</strong></p><p>Critical infrastructure in restricted areas. Biometric access. Logging. Monitoring.</p></div>
                <div class="value-card"><h3>5. Asset</h3><p><strong>Cable locks, encryption, tracking.</strong></p><p>Secure individual assets. Laptop locks. Full disk encryption. Asset tracking.</p></div>
            </div>
            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            <p>Our physical security is public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Badge access</strong> - All offices require badge entry, logged</li>
                <li><strong>Visitor management</strong> - Sign-in, escort, logging</li>
                <li><strong>Server room access</strong> - Restricted to authorized personnel only</li>
                <li><strong>Asset encryption</strong> - Full disk encryption on all devices</li>
                <li><strong>Security awareness</strong> - Train staff not to tailgate, hold doors</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Physical security is social engineering defense. Teach staff to challenge unknown people. Don't hold doors. Don't plug in found USBs. Vigilance is control.</div>
            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Guard the Physical</h2>
            <p>Physical access = game over. <strong>Lock doors. Challenge unknowns. Don't hold doors.</strong> Layer security from perimeter to asset. Or find out that your impenetrable network was bypassed by someone walking in with confidence.</p>
