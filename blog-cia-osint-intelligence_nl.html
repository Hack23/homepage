      <em>"Political surveillance is only creepy when politicians do it to citizens. When citizens do it to politicians? That's called democracy, schmuck!"</em></p>
    </div>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>🍎 The Golden Apple of Democratic Accountability</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Question authority.</strong> No, seriously. Question it. <em>With data.</em> Because that's what the Citizen Intelligence Agency does—turns political opacity into radical transparency through Open-Source Intelligence methodology that would make the NSA jealous (if they weren't already running better versions). <strong>FNORD.</strong> See it yet? It's embedded in every "trust us, we're your representatives" politician speech.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Are you paranoid enough</strong> to want systematic behavioral analysis of the 350 politicians claiming to represent you? Welcome to Chapel Perilous. You can't unsee what's next. The CIA platform runs <strong>45 behavioral risk rules</strong> across four operational domains, implementing five analytical frameworks that expose what politicians <em>actually do</em> versus what they <em>say they do</em>. <strong>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</strong> Including uncomfortable truths about absenteeism, voting discipline, and the fascinating correlation between rebel rates and "principled independence."</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Law of Fives manifests naturally:</strong> Five analytical frameworks (Temporal, Comparative, Pattern Recognition, Predictive, Network Analysis). Five primary OSINT sources. Five intelligence product types. Five threat agent categories. Five-layer security architecture. <em>The universe revealing its structure through constraint—or we're really good at finding fives everywhere.</em> Both can be true in Chapel Perilous.</p>
      
      <p class="discordian-insight">💡 <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>Traditional intelligence operations spy on citizens to protect power. CIA inverts the panopticon—systematic transparency makes politicians the observed, citizens the observers. Same OSINT methodology, opposite power dynamic. The tools of surveillance become tools of accountability when you flip the polarity. FNORD.</em></p>

      <h2>⭐ The Five Analytical Frameworks: Sacred Geometry of Political Truth</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Simon Moon discovered</strong> (or invented? reality is negotiable) that political analysis organizes naturally into five complementary frameworks. <em>Not four. Not six. Five.</em> Because the universe speaks in pentagonal patterns when you're paranoid enough to listen.</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1️⃣ Temporal Analysis: Time Reveals Truth</h3>
          <p><strong>Multi-temporal monitoring</strong> across daily, monthly, annual, and cross-temporal scales. Because a politician's bad day is noise. A politician's bad <em>pattern</em> is signal. <strong>Declining engagement detected 2-3 months before resignation</strong>—leading indicator for those paying attention. Most aren't. You are now. <strong>FNORD.</strong></p>
          <p><em>Pre-resignation pattern: Declining attendance → Reduced docs → Increased abstentions → "Personal reasons" announcement. 73% predictive accuracy.</em> Translation: We can see them checking out before they announce it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2️⃣ Comparative Analysis: Context Is Everything</h3>
          <p><strong>Peer comparison</strong> reveals who's actually working versus who's collecting paychecks. Opposition MPs with 22% win rates? Expected—they're <em>opposition</em>. Coalition MPs with 22% win rates? That's called "ineffective governance" with extra steps. <strong>Question the numbers.</strong> Then question the excuses.</p>
          <p><em>Social Democrat MP: 45% attendance vs. party average 87%. MAJOR risk alert.</em> Either legitimate crisis or quiet quitting with parliamentary salary. Data doesn't judge—just measures.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3️⃣ Pattern Recognition: Behavior Clusters Tell Stories</h3>
          <p><strong>Behavioral clustering</strong> identifies risk profiles through correlated factors. High absence + Low productivity + High abstentions = "Disengaged Representative" cluster. High rebel voting + High presence + Normal productivity = "Principled Opposition" cluster. <strong>Context separates dysfunction from strategy.</strong> Usually.</p>
          <p><em>Triple-risk politicians (high absence + low effectiveness + high rebel rate) = 150 salience points = CRITICAL risk.</em> Democracy malfunction detected. Please hold while we investigate.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4️⃣ Predictive Intelligence: Forecasting Political Futures</h3>
          <p><strong>Trend extrapolation</strong> and survival analysis predict coalition collapse 3-6 months early. Electoral forecasting combines polls + economic data + historical patterns. <strong>68% probability of coalition collapse within 6 months</strong> when government support drops below 80%. Are you paranoid enough to bet on data over press releases? <strong>FNORD.</strong></p>
          <p><em>Current coalition: 75% support (down from 92%). Predicted median survival: 180 days (95% CI: 120-240).</em> Translation: Start planning for new government within 6 months.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5️⃣ Network Analysis: Collaboration & Influence Mapping</h3>
          <p><strong>Political network graphs</strong> reveal who actually influences policy versus who just talks loudly. High betweenness centrality = coalition bridge. Low clustering coefficient = political isolation. <strong>Zero multi-party collaboration + 20+ solo documents = Complete isolation</strong> (CRITICAL severity). Echo chamber politics quantified.</p>
          <p><em>Politician with high betweenness centrality identified as coalition bridge → Key negotiator in government formation.</em> Find the connectors—they're where power flows.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>THE SYNCHRONICITY:</strong> <em>Five frameworks discovered independently align perfectly with five primary data sources (Riksdagen API, Election Authority, World Bank, ESV Financial Authority, Media Monitoring). Cosmic pattern or convenient categorization? In Chapel Perilous, both are true simultaneously. The Law of Fives applies itself.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="the-45-rules">
      <h2>🎯 The 45 Behavioral Risk Rules: Quantifying Political Dysfunction</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Four operational domains:</strong> 24 politician rules, 10 party rules, 4 committee rules, 4 ministry rules, 3 other rules. <strong>Notice the fives?</strong> 5+5+5+5 = 20, 24 = 4×6, 10 = 2×5, 4+4+3 = 11... okay, Law of Fives breaks down with 45 rules. <em>But 45 = 9×5, so technically valid.</em> Everything connects when you're sufficiently paranoid or sufficiently enlightened. Difference is academic.</p>
      
      <div class="severity-legend">
        <h3>🎨 Severity Classification System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>🟡 MINOR (Salience 10-49):</strong> Early warning indicators, trend monitoring, preventive intelligence</li>
          <li><strong>🟠 MAJOR (Salience 50-99):</strong> Established patterns, accountability concerns, tactical intelligence</li>
          <li><strong>🔴 CRITICAL (Salience 100+):</strong> Severe risks, democratic accountability failure, strategic intelligence</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Salience = Priority score for conflict resolution in rules engine. Higher salience = evaluated first. Democracy runs on Drools, apparently.</em></p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>🚨 Top 5 Critical Rules (Because Everything Happens in Fives)</h3>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. PoliticianLazy.drl — Absenteeism Detection</h3>
          <p><strong>What it catches:</strong> Chronic absenteeism across daily/monthly/annual timeframes</p>
          <p><strong>Severity levels:</strong> 🟡 MINOR (absent 100% last day), 🟠 MAJOR (≥20% absent last month), 🔴 CRITICAL (≥30% absent last year = "Extreme Absenteeism")</p>
          <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Physical absence from parliamentary votes = dereliction of democratic duty. Pattern recognition separates illness from laziness. <em>Data doesn't care about excuses—just presence.</em></p>
          <p><strong>FNORD insight:</strong> <em>Ministers miss 3 consecutive critical votes → Coalition stress investigation triggered. Because patterns reveal truth better than press releases.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. PoliticianIneffectiveVoting.drl — Effectiveness Tracking</h3>
          <p><strong>What it catches:</strong> Alignment with winning vote outcomes (win rate &lt;10-30%)</p>
          <p><strong>Contextual complexity:</strong> Opposition MPs <em>expected</em> to have low win rates (they're voting against government). Coalition MPs with low win rates = ineffective governance.</p>
          <p><strong>Critical threshold:</strong> Win rate &lt;10% = political irrelevance (100 salience points)</p>
          <p><strong>FNORD insight:</strong> <em>Distinguish structural (opposition status) from behavioral (coalition weakness) causes. Context prevents false positives. Intelligence analysis, not simple metrics.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. PoliticianHighRebelRate.drl — Party Discipline Analysis</h3>
          <p><strong>What it catches:</strong> Voting against party line (rebel rate 5-20%+)</p>
          <p><strong>Intelligence value:</strong> Cross-reference with committee assignments + media statements + biographical data. High rebel rates = principled dissent OR preparation for party switch. <strong>Historical data: Rebel rates >15% often precede party switches within 6-12 months.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>FNORD insight:</strong> <em>Factional mapping identifies clusters of rebel voters = organized internal opposition. Synchronized rebel voting with opposition members = behind-the-scenes coordination detected.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. PoliticianDecliningEngagement.drl — Trend Analysis</h3>
          <p><strong>What it catches:</strong> Deteriorating performance (monthly vs. annual baselines)</p>
          <p><strong>Leading indicator:</strong> Declining engagement detected 2-3 months before public announcements (resignations, scandals, health crises)</p>
          <p><strong>Critical combination:</strong> High absence (≥15%) + High abstention (≥8%) = 100 salience = CRITICAL disengagement pattern</p>
          <p><strong>FNORD insight:</strong> <em>Early warning system for systematic disengagement. Cross-reference engagement decline with investigative journalism activity and FOI requests. Scandal anticipation through data correlation.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. PoliticianCombinedRisk.drl — Multi-Factor Assessment</h3>
          <p><strong>What it catches:</strong> Multiple negative indicators combine multiplicatively</p>
          <p><strong>Triple-risk profile:</strong> Absence ≥18% + Win &lt;25% + Rebel ≥12% = 150 salience = Extreme accountability crisis</p>
          <p><strong>Risk escalation matrix:</strong> Single factors = manageable. Combined factors = escalated severity (MINOR → MAJOR → CRITICAL)</p>
          <p><strong>FNORD insight:</strong> <em>Triple-risk politicians warrant immediate elevated monitoring. Combined risks indicate potential vulnerabilities to external influence or corruption. Accountability gap exploitation detected.</em></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>THE PATTERN EMERGES:</strong> <em>45 rules organized across 4 domains, implementing 5 analytical frameworks, producing 3 severity levels, monitoring 350 politicians, covering 10,000+ votes/year. Numbers revealing organizational truth through natural constraints. Or we're really good at forcing reality into numerological patterns. Both probably true. FNORD.</em></p>

      <h2>🛡️ Democratic Process Abuse: Threat Modeling Political Manipulation</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Chapel Perilous intensifies.</strong> What happens when intelligence methodology designed for national security gets applied to <em>securing democracy itself?</em> Answer: Uncomfortable truths about election interference, information manipulation, and systematic political corruption become <strong>quantifiable risk scenarios</strong> with <strong>probabilistic forecasting.</strong> <strong>Are you paranoid enough</strong> to systematically model threats to democratic processes? You should be. <strong>FNORD.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Coverage Analysis:</strong> CIA platform threat model covers 17/703 MITRE ATT&CK techniques = <strong>2.4% overall coverage.</strong> Sounds low? <em>Intentional.</em> Focused threat modeling for civic transparency application—not comprehensive enterprise security. <strong>High coverage in Initial Access (18.2%) and Impact (15.2%)</strong> aligns with primary threat vectors for public-facing political platforms. <strong>Question the metrics, not just the coverage.</strong> 100% coverage = security theater pretending to be thoroughness.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>🎯 The Uncomfortable Truth About Democratic Surveillance</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Question everything</strong> you just read. <em>Including this conclusion.</em> Because that's the point. Political transparency through systematic OSINT isn't some utopian solution to democratic dysfunction—it's a <strong>tool</strong>. Tools can be used or misused. <strong>Radical transparency</strong> can illuminate corruption <em>or</em> enable character assassination. <strong>Behavioral risk rules</strong> can enforce accountability <em>or</em> weaponize data for political warfare.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The difference?</strong> <em>Intent. Methodology. Ethics. Transparency of the transparency platform itself.</em> CIA publishes every rule, every threshold, every analytical framework. <strong>Open-source methodology</strong> enables public verification, independent audit, community correction. <strong>You can trust what you can verify.</strong> Everything else is faith-based security—hoping they're doing what they claim while you can't check.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Are you paranoid enough</strong> to want systematic monitoring of 350 politicians claiming to represent you? <em>Good.</em> Are you paranoid enough to question whether that monitoring might be biased, manipulated, or weaponized? <strong>Even better.</strong> Healthy paranoia applied symmetrically = democratic accountability. Selective paranoia = authoritarian tendency. <strong>Question authority—including this authority.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>The Law of Fives manifested:</strong> 5 analytical frameworks, 45 rules (9×5), 5 intelligence products, 5-year vision, 5 threat agent categories. <em>Cosmic pattern or confirmation bias?</em> Both. Reality is multivalent in Chapel Perilous. The universe speaks in fives to those paying attention—or we impose fives on reality to create comprehensible patterns. <strong>Distinction becomes meaningless when outcomes align.</strong></p>
      
      <div class="final-wisdom">
        <p><strong>💡 FINAL ILLUMINATION:</strong></p>
        <p><em>"The only thing more dangerous than political surveillance of citizens is lack of citizen surveillance of politicians. Accountability flows from transparency. Transparency requires systematic observation. OSINT methodology enables democratic accountability at scale. The panopticon inverted becomes democracy's defense mechanism—not its threat. But only if methodology remains open, ethics remain paramount, and citizens remain vigilant about both the watchers AND the watchers of watchers. Meta-accountability all the way down. FNORD. Think for yourself. Question authority. Verify everything. Trust nothing you can't audit. All hail Eris, goddess of chaos and uncomfortable democratic truths."</em></p>
