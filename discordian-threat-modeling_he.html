      <h2 class="panel-caption">Public Threat Models: Every Project, Every Attack Vector, Every Mitigation</h2>
      
      <p><strong>שום דבר לא אמיתי. הכל מותר.</strong> Including publishing your complete threat models publicly because security through obscurity is security through hoping adversaries are too lazy to look. <em>They're not lazy. They're patient. They're well-funded. They're already inside your perimeter that doesn't exist anymore.</em> Publishing threat models doesn't help attackers—they already know the attack vectors better than you do. It helps defenders learn systematic threat analysis instead of security through wishful thinking and vendor promises.</p>
      
      <p><em>תחשוב בעצמך, schmuck! הטל ספק בסמכות.</em> At Hack23, we don't hide our threat models behind NDAs and "confidential" markings—we publish them so you can verify our security claims instead of trusting our marketing. <strong>STRIDE complete. Attack trees documented. Mitigations mapped. Risk quantified.</strong> All public. All auditable. All improvable through community review. <strong>האם אתה פרנואיד מספיק to publish YOUR threat models? We are—because transparency forces quality better than audits ever did.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Every Hack23 project maintains comprehensive threat models: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia/blob/master/THREAT_MODEL.md">CIA (democratic engagement)</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/blacktrigram/blob/main/THREAT_MODEL.md">Black Trigram (educational gaming)</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-ציות-manager/blob/main/docs/architecture/THREAT_MODEL.md">CIA ציות Manager (security assessment)</a>. STRIDE analysis, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, AI/ML ATLAS integration for LLM threats—all documented, all public, all continuously updated. <em>Static threat models are fiction. Threats evolve daily. Documentation must evolve with them or become expensive security theater.</em></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>ILLUMINATION: Publishing threat models doesn't help attackers—they already know the attack vectors from years of breaching companies who thought security through obscurity would protect them. It helps defenders learn systematic threat analysis through real examples instead of theoretical frameworks nobody implements. Choose transparent defense over obscure hope. Choose documented threats over imaginary safety. <strong>FNORD.</strong> Your threat model should include nation-states because their threat models include you. Act accordingly.</em></p>
      
      <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Threat_Modeling.md">דוגמת איומים Policy</a> isn't theoretical—it's operational with public evidence across all projects. Security by design through systematic threat analysis.</p>

      <p>Different adversaries, different capabilities, different motivations:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Script Kiddies</strong> — Low skill, automated tools, mass scans. Defend with basics.</li>
        <li><strong>Cybercriminals</strong> — Financially motivated, targeted, patient. Ransomware, exfiltration, fraud.</li>
        <li><strong>Insiders</strong> — Already have access. Your biggest threat that security teams ignore.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitors</strong> — Corporate espionage. They want your IP, your customers, your secrets.</li>
        <li><strong>Nation-States</strong> — Infinite resources, zero-days, supply chain access, legal compulsion. If they want in, they're in.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Your threat model should include the worst case</strong>—nation-state adversaries—because that sets your defensive baseline. If you can defend against APTs, script kiddies are noise.</p>

      <p><strong>שום דבר לא אמיתי. הכל מותר.</strong> Including publishing complete threat models because transparency demonstrates expertise, not vulnerability.</p>
      
      <p>Most organizations hide threat models behind NDAs. We publish ours: <strong>STRIDE complete. Attack trees documented. Mitigations mapped. Risk quantified.</strong> All public. CIA Platform, Black Trigram, CIA ציות Manager—every project has comprehensive threat model.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Our דוגמת איומים approach:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>STRIDE Framework:</strong> Six threat categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)</li>
        <li><strong>AI/ML ATLAS:</strong> 15 tactics, 81 techniques for LLM-specific threats (prompt injection, training data poisoning, model inversion)</li>
        <li><strong>MITRE ATT&CK:</strong> Industry-standard threat intelligence integration</li>
        <li><strong>Public Documentation:</strong> Transparent threat analysis in every project repository</li>
        <li><strong>Control Mapping:</strong> Every threat mapped to specific security controls</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Assessment:</strong> Threat models updated with architectural changes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>תחשוב בעצמך.</strong> Question vendors who hide threat models. Ask for public STRIDE analysis. Demand attack tree documentation. Choose transparent threat assessment over obscure hand-waving.</p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><strong>ULTIMATE ILLUMINATION:</strong> <em>You are now in Chapel Perilous. Every system is attackable. Publishing threat models doesn't help attackers—they already know the attack vectors. It helps defenders learn systematic threat analysis. Choose transparency over obscurity.</em></p>
