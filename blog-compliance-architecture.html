    <section id="trinity-pentacle">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">When Three Becomes Five Becomes Fifteen</h2>
      
      <p><strong>The CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.</strong> Three pillars of information security since the 1970s. Fundamental. Immutable. Complete.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Or so conventional wisdom claimed.</strong> Until I architected the <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager">CIA Compliance Manager</a> and discovered: three principles × five maturity levels = fifteen control points. The trinity revealed as pentacle in disguise.</p>
      
      <p>Think for yourself. Everyone knows "CIA" = Confidentiality + Integrity + Availability. But <em>how many levels of confidentiality?</em> How many integrity states? How many availability tiers? The answer: five each. Always five. The Law of Fives hiding within the trinity.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Synchronistic discovery:</strong> Designing the maturity model, I initially sketched four levels (none, basic, intermediate, advanced). Felt incomplete. Added fifth level (optimized). Suddenly coherent. Then realized: NIST Cybersecurity Framework uses five functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). ISO 27001 uses five process categories. CMMI uses five maturity levels. <em>The pattern was always there.</em></p>
      
      <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Illumination: Sacred numbers don't impose structure—they reveal structure already present. The CIA Triad contains fifteen sub-principles because information security problems naturally cluster into 3×5 patterns.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="five-architectural-layers">
      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Architectural Layers</h2>
      
      <p><strong>React + TypeScript + Vite = modern web stack.</strong> But architecture transcends technology choices. The structure manifesting in five layers regardless of implementation details.</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>1. 🎨 Presentation Layer: Radix UI Components</h3>
          <p><strong>Five component categories:</strong> Forms (control input), Charts (data visualization), Tables (structured display), Dialogs (user interaction), Navigation (wayfinding). Each category contains 5-7 primitive components. Fibonacci range—small enough for cognitive load, large enough for composition.</p>
          <p><strong>Design system based on golden ratio:</strong> Typography scales by φ (1.618). Spacing grid in 5px increments. Color palettes with 5 shades per hue. Layout responsive at 5 breakpoints (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, ultrawide). Mathematics encoded in visual design.</p>
          <p><strong>Accessibility first:</strong> ARIA labels on 100% of interactive elements. Keyboard navigation supporting 5 navigation patterns (tab, arrow, escape, enter, space). Screen reader tested against 5 popular readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack, Narrator). WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance—not because required, because <em>right</em>.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>UI that fights muscle memory fails usability. UI that aligns with user mental models succeeds. Our five component categories match how users think about compliance: data input, data review, data analysis, exception handling, workflow navigation.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>2. 🧩 Application Layer: React State Management</h3>
          <p><strong>Zustand stores organized in five domains:</strong> Assessment (current evaluation state), Controls (security control catalog), Frameworks (NIST/ISO/CIS mappings), Reports (generated outputs), Settings (user preferences). Each store self-contained. Cross-store communication via publish/subscribe—loose coupling.</p>
          <p><strong>State lifecycle in five phases:</strong> Initial (component mount), Loading (async fetch), Synced (remote data cached), Modified (user edits uncommitted), Persisted (changes saved). Clean transitions. No ambiguous states. Boolean flags would create 2^5 = 32 possible combinations—five-phase FSM maintains 5 valid states total.</p>
          <p><strong>React hooks custom-built:</strong> useAssessment, useControls, useFrameworks, useReports, useSettings. One hook per domain. Encapsulation through composability. Client code never directly touches stores—always through hooks interface.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Application state that leaks across boundaries creates maintenance nightmares. State contained within well-defined boundaries enables confident refactoring. Our five-domain separation proven through 85% test coverage—validated isolation.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card availability-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>3. 💼 Business Logic Layer: Compliance Calculations</h3>
          <p><strong>The core intelligence.</strong> TypeScript pure functions implementing compliance mathematics. Five calculation engines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Maturity Scoring:</strong> 3 principles × 5 levels × 1 control type = 15 weighted scores aggregated via golden ratio</li>
            <li><strong>Gap Analysis:</strong> Target state - current state across 15 control points</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Quantification:</strong> Likelihood × Impact scored 1-5, matrix producing 25 risk levels, clustered into 5 risk categories</li>
            <li><strong>Control Mapping:</strong> NIST CSF, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, PCI-DSS, HIPAA = 5 frameworks auto-mapped to CIA Triad</li>
            <li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Time-series data showing maturity evolution over last 5 assessments</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Mathematics validated through property-based testing:</strong> QuickCheck-style fuzzing generating 10,000 random inputs per function. Invariants verified: maturity scores always 0-100%, gaps always sum to zero (conservation law), risk levels always decrease with improved controls. Math that provably works.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Business logic that can't be tested without integration tests is too coupled. Business logic that runs identically in Node.js, browser, and Deno is pure enough for confidence. Our calculations are pure functions—testable, predictable, reliable.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>4. 💾 Data Layer: IndexedDB Persistence</h3>
          <p><strong>Client-side database for offline-first compliance.</strong> Five object stores: assessments, controls, frameworks, reports, metadata. Each store with indexed queries for fast retrieval.</p>
          <p><strong>Data schema versioning:</strong> Currently v5 (the synchronicity continues). Migration scripts for v1→v2, v2→v3, v3→v4, v4→v5. Each migration tested with real production data exports. No user data loss across five major schema evolutions.</p>
          <p><strong>Sync strategy:</strong> Local-first with optional cloud backup. User owns data in IndexedDB. Export to JSON/CSV anytime. Import from previous exports. No vendor lock-in. Data portability fundamental to trust.</p>
          <p><strong>GDPR by design:</strong> Right to access (export feature), right to erasure (clear database button), right to portability (standard JSON format), right to rectification (edit any field), right to restrict processing (offline mode default). Five rights, five features, one-to-one mapping.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Data persistence that requires network connectivity fails during internet outages—exactly when compliance review might be critical. Offline-first with optional sync provides resilience.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <div class="scanner-effect"></div>
          <h3>5. ☁️ Infrastructure Layer: Static Hosting + CDN</h3>
          <p><strong>Simplest architecture wins.</strong> Static site hosted on GitHub Pages. CloudFlare CDN for global distribution. No server-side components = no server-side vulnerabilities. Attack surface: minimal.</p>
          <p><strong>Build pipeline in five stages:</strong> Lint (ESLint), Type-check (TypeScript), Test (Vitest), Build (Vite), Deploy (GitHub Actions). Each stage automated. Each stage blocking. Quality gates that actually gate.</p>
          <p><strong>Performance budget:</strong> First Contentful Paint < 1.5s, Time to Interactive < 3.5s, Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s, Total Blocking Time < 300ms, Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1. Five Core Web Vitals plus our own. Lighthouse CI enforcing thresholds on every commit. See <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager/blob/master/budget.json">budget.json</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Hosting costs: $0/month.</strong> GitHub Pages free for public repos. CloudFlare free tier sufficient. Open-source compliance tool with zero hosting fees. Sustainability through simplicity.</p>
          <p class="hidden-wisdom"><em>Infrastructure complexity creates operational burden. Serverless architecture isn't always the answer—sometimes stateless client-side is simpler still. Choose simplicity unless complexity proves necessary.</em></p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">The Five Frameworks: Universal Compliance</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Security compliance isn't framework-specific.</strong> NIST CSF, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, PCI-DSS, HIPAA—all variations on the same theme: protect CIA triad. Our tool maps them all.</p>
      
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework</h3>
          <p><strong>Five functions perfectly matching our architecture:</strong> Identify (assessment), Protect (controls), Detect (monitoring), Respond (incident handling), Recover (business continuity). Synchronicity: NIST revealed the Law of Fives before we encoded it in software.</p>
          <p><strong>Implementation maturity levels:</strong> Tier 1 (Partial) → Tier 4 (Adaptive). We map these to our 5-level scale, treating Tier 0 (None) as implicit. Result: 1-to-1 mapping between NIST tiers and our maturity model.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card integrity-card">
          <h3>2. ISO 27001:2022</h3>
          <p><strong>Annexes organized in our five-domain structure:</strong> Organizational (policies), People (training), Physical (premises), Technological (systems), Legal (compliance). Each annex mapped to CIA triad control points. Cross-reference table in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager/blob/master/control-mapping.md">control-mapping.md</a>.</p>

Our tool auto-recommends which controls based on current maturity assessment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card confidentiality-card">
          <h3>4. PCI-DSS 4.0</h3>
          <p><strong>12 requirements mapping cleanly to CIA:</strong> Confidentiality (Requirements 1-4), Integrity (5-6,8-11), Availability (7,12). Payment security = CIA triad specialized for financial transactions. Same principles, different domain.</p>

      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Universal compliance through pattern recognition:</strong> All frameworks protect same three principles at five maturity levels.

      <h2 class="panel-caption">C4 Models: Five Views of Compliance</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Context → Container → Component → Code → Cloud.</strong> The pattern persists. Full diagrams in <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager">repository</a>.</p>
      
      <p><strong>System Context:</strong> Compliance Manager, Security Frameworks (NIST/ISO/CIS/PCI/HIPAA), IndexedDB, GitHub OAuth (optional), CloudFlare CDN. Five external systems interacting with our application. Minimal dependencies = minimal attack surface.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Container View:</strong> React SPA (single runtime container) + five data stores (IndexedDB object stores) + five framework definition files (JSON schemas). Architecture so simple it fits on one diagram.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Component Diagram:</strong> Five React component families (forms, charts, tables, dialogs, navigation) + five Zustand stores (assessment, controls, frameworks, reports, settings) + five calculation engines (maturity, gap, risk, mapping, trend). Fractal fives.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Code Organization:</strong> Five top-level directories: components/ (presentation), store/ (state), logic/ (business rules), data/ (schemas), tests/ (validation). Each directory subdivided into five categories. Recursive structure.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Deployment:</strong> Vite build → GitHub Actions CI → GitHub Pages hosting → CloudFlare CDN → 5 global regions. From localhost to worldwide in 5 steps. Simplicity enabling velocity.</p>

      <h2 class="panel-caption">Developer Experience: The Fifth Pillar</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Often forgotten. Never optional.</strong> Architecture serving developers serving users. Five DX principles:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Type Safety Everywhere:</strong> TypeScript strict mode. Zero `any` types. Compile-time error detection. Runtime errors prevented by type system. 100% type coverage validated by `tsc --noEmit`.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Fast Feedback Loops:</strong> Vite HMR updating in < 50ms. Vitest tests completing in < 5 seconds. ESLint linting in < 2 seconds. Type-check in < 10 seconds. No waiting for builds. Flow state maintained.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Testing:</strong> 85% code coverage (target: 90% by year 2). Unit tests for logic, integration tests for stores, E2E tests for workflows, property-based tests for invariants, visual regression tests for UI. Five test types catching five error types.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Clear Documentation:</strong> TypeDoc for API docs, Mermaid for diagrams, README for getting started, ARCHITECTURE.md for design decisions, CONTRIBUTING.md for collaboration. Five doc types for five audience types (users, developers, architects, contributors, auditors).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Automated Quality Gates:</strong> Pre-commit hooks (lint + type-check), CI pipeline (test + build), Lighthouse (performance), Dependency scanning (security), License compliance (FOSSA). Five gates preventing five bug categories from reaching production.</li>

      <p><strong>Building a compliance automation tool taught me:</strong></p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Three is incomplete. Five is complete.</strong> CIA Triad feels authoritative because it's three. But three maturity levels are insufficient. Five levels provide nuance. The trinity concealing the pentacle.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Client-side architecture reduces compliance scope.</strong> No server = no server vulnerabilities. No user data stored server-side = no GDPR server requirements. Simplicity through subtraction.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Framework mappings unlock competitive advantage.</strong> Consultants monetize knowing NIST + ISO + CIS + PCI + HIPAA separately. We codified the mappings—open source. Democratizing compliance knowledge.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Type safety prevents entire bug classes.</strong> TypeScript catching errors at compile-time vs. JavaScript discovering them in production. Worth the ceremony. Runtime confidence through static analysis.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Automated evidence > manual documentation.</strong> OpenSSF Scorecard, SLSA attestations, test coverage reports, Lighthouse scores—continuous proof of quality. Can't fake automation. Can fake manual claims.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>See the patterns yourself:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager">Source Repository</a> - Read TypeScript, study React patterns</li>
        <li><a href="https://hack23.github.io/cia-compliance-manager">Live Application</a> - Use the tool, assess your systems</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md">Architecture Documentation</a> - C4 models, design decisions</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager/blob/master/control-mapping.md">Framework Mappings</a> - NIST/ISO/CIS/PCI/HIPAA cross-reference</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager/blob/master/FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md">Future Roadmap</a> - Five-year evolution plan</li>
        <li><a href="https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager">OpenSSF Scorecard</a> - Automated security validation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Think for yourself.</strong> Run the tool. Review the code. Map your own frameworks. The CIA Triad + Law of Fives pattern works because it reflects information security reality, not because we documented it. We just made the pattern visible.</p>
