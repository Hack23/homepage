            <p class="subtitle"><em>"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. That email is fake."</em></p>

            <h2>�� The Problem: Email Is Insecure By Design</h2>
            
            <p>Email was designed in 1971 for trustworthy academics. <strong>It's 2025 and email still has no built-in security.</strong> SMTP allows sender spoofing. Authentication is optional. Encryption is rare.</p>
            
            <p>Your CEO doesn't need iTunes gift cards. That's not your CEO. Email is the primary attack vector because it works.</p>
            
            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>ILLUMINATION:</strong> Your CEO doesn't need iTunes cards. That's not your CEO. Email sender addresses are trivially spoofed. Verify unusual requests out of band.
            </div>

            <h2>🎣 The Five Email Threats</h2>
            
            <div class="value-grid">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>1. Phishing</h3>
                    <p><strong>Click this link to verify your account.</strong></p>
                    <p>Fake emails impersonating legitimate services. Credential theft. Malware delivery. Happens constantly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>2. Spear Phishing</h3>
                    <p><strong>Targeted attacks using personal information.</strong></p>
                    <p>Researched attacks against specific individuals. More convincing. Higher success rate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>3. Business Email Compromise</h3>
                    <p><strong>CEO wants wire transfer ASAP.</strong></p>
                    <p>Impersonating executives. Requesting wire transfers. Millions lost annually. Verify out of band.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>4. Malware Delivery</h3>
                    <p><strong>Invoice.pdf.exe attached.</strong></p>
                    <p>Malicious attachments. Macro-enabled documents. Ransomware delivery. Don't open suspicious attachments.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h3>5. Email Spoofing</h3>
                    <p><strong>From: ceo@yourcompany.com (but not really)</strong></p>
                    <p>SMTP allows forged sender addresses. SPF/DKIM/DMARC help but aren't universal. Verify suspicious emails.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>CHAOS ILLUMINATION:</strong> Email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) is optional. Most domains don't configure it. Your domain probably doesn't either. Check now.
            </div>

            <h2>🛡️ Email Security Controls</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SPF</strong> - Sender Policy Framework: Which servers can send email for your domain</li>
                <li><strong>DKIM</strong> - DomainKeys Identified Mail: Cryptographic signature on emails</li>
                <li><strong>DMARC</strong> - Domain-based Message Authentication: Policy for handling authentication failures</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-spam filters</strong> - Block known spam and phishing</li>
                <li><strong>Link scanning</strong> - Check URLs before users click</li>
                <li><strong>Attachment sandboxing</strong> - Execute attachments in isolated environment</li>
                <li><strong>User training</strong> - Teach users to recognize phishing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>📋 What Hack23 Actually Does</h2>
            
            <p>Our email security config is public: <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC" target="_blank">ISMS-PUBLIC Repository</a> | <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Email_Security_Policy.md" target="_blank">Email Security Policy</a></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SPF/DKIM/DMARC configured</strong> - Reject unauthenticated emails</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced threat protection</strong> - Link scanning, attachment sandboxing</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing simulations</strong> - Monthly tests with immediate training</li>
                <li><strong>External email warnings</strong> - Banner on emails from outside organization</li>
                <li><strong>Out-of-band verification</strong> - Wire transfer requests verified by phone</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="hidden-wisdom">
                <strong>META-ILLUMINATION:</strong> Email will never be secure. It's fundamentally broken. Layer controls to compensate. Train users. Verify unusual requests. Accept that phishing will succeed sometimes.
            </div>

            <h2>🎯 Conclusion: Verify Before Clicking</h2>
            
            <p>Email is the primary attack vector. <strong>Phishing works because it exploits trust.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC. Use advanced threat protection. Train users. Verify unusual requests. Or find out that your CFO wired $500K to attackers because an email looked legitimate.</p>
