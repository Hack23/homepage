# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

You are assisting with a static HTML/CSS website project focused on clear security messaging and accessible design. Please note the following guidelines:

1. Maintain consistency with the established design patterns.
2. Ensure the code is clean, minimal, and responsive.
3. Do not add new featuresâ€”only fix bugs and improve existing content.
4. Follow accessibility standards (e.g. WCAG 2.1 AA) for all interactive elements.
5. Provide microcopy and tooltips where needed to explain security terminology.
6. Keep the repository structure and naming conventions intact.

Focus on stability, clarity, and correctness in every change.
