# Brand Voice & Tone Skill

## Purpose

Defines Hack23's brand voice, tone, and messaging standards to ensure consistent, authentic, and effective communication that reflects our transparency values and cybersecurity expertise.

## Rules

### Brand Voice (Consistent Across All Content)

**Core Voice Attributes:**
```markdown
1. Transparent
   - Open about processes, policies, and pricing
   - Share knowledge freely (ISMS, documentation, code)
   - Admit limitations and areas for improvement
   - No hidden agendas or fine print

2. Expert Yet Accessible
   - Deep technical knowledge, explained clearly
   - Avoid unnecessary jargon
   - Use analogies for complex concepts
   - Respect audience intelligence

3. Practical & Action-Oriented
   - Focus on implementable solutions
   - Provide concrete examples and templates
   - Emphasize "how-to" over theory
   - Show don't just tell

4. Confident Without Arrogance
   - 30+ years experience = earned authority
   - Let expertise speak through quality
   - Acknowledge others' contributions
   - Collaborative, not competitive

5. No FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)
   - Security through empowerment, not fear
   - Realistic risk assessment, not scaremongering
   - Focus on solutions, not just problems
   - Build confidence, don't undermine it
```

### Tone Variations by Context

**Educational Content (Blog, Guides, Documentation):**
```markdown
Tone: Instructive, patient, encouraging
Example: "Let's walk through ISO 27001 implementation step by step. 
Don't worry if this seems complex at first—we'll break it down into 
manageable pieces."
```

**Marketing & Sales (Website, Brochures, Proposals):**
```markdown
Tone: Professional, confident, value-focused
Example: "Hack23 delivers practical cybersecurity that accelerates 
your business, backed by 30 years of hands-on experience and a 
transparent, public ISMS."
```

**Technical Content (Architecture Docs, Code, APIs):**
```markdown
Tone: Precise, detailed, objective
Example: "The authentication module implements JWT-based access 
control with RS256 signing, enforcing 2048-bit minimum key length 
per Cryptography Policy §3.2."
```

**Social Media (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub):**
```markdown
Tone: Conversational, engaging, authentic
Example: "Proud to open-source our complete ISMS framework today. 
Transparency isn't just a value—it's how we build trust. Check it 
out: [link]"
```

**Customer Support (Email, Chat, Issues):**
```markdown
Tone: Helpful, empathetic, solution-oriented
Example: "I understand the authentication issue is blocking your 
deployment. Let's troubleshoot this together. Can you share the 
error log from section 4.2?"
```

### Writing Style Guidelines

**MUST:**
```markdown
Sentence Structure:
- Use active voice ("We implement security" not "Security is implemented")
- Vary sentence length for readability
- One main idea per sentence
- Start with the most important information

Paragraphs:
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- One topic per paragraph
- Use transition words between paragraphs
- Break up long blocks with subheadings

Lists & Formatting:
- Use bullet points for 3+ related items
- Number steps in sequential processes
- Bold key terms on first use
- Use code blocks for technical examples

Clarity:
- Choose simple words over complex ones
- Define acronyms on first use
- Avoid double negatives
- Be specific, not vague
```

**MUST NOT:**
```markdown
- Use FUD tactics or scare language
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Use excessive buzzwords or jargon
- Write in passive voice habitually
- Create walls of text without breaks
- Use all caps (except acronyms)
- Overuse exclamation points
```

### Messaging Framework

**Positioning Statement:**
```
For [Swedish tech companies and regulated organizations] who need 
[practical cybersecurity that doesn't slow innovation], Hack23 is 
[a transparent security consulting firm] that provides [hands-on 
expertise backed by a public ISMS and 30 years of experience], 
unlike [traditional security vendors who use FUD tactics and 
proprietary methods].
```

**Key Messages by Audience:**

**For CTOs:**
```markdown
Primary: "Integrate security into development without sacrificing velocity"
Supporting:
- DevSecOps patterns that work with your existing tools
- Security automation that fits your CI/CD pipeline
- Architecture guidance from experienced practitioners
- Open documentation you can reference and adapt
```

**For CISOs:**
```markdown
Primary: "Accelerate compliance with proven, transparent frameworks"
Supporting:
- Complete ISMS templates (ISO 27001, NIST, CIS)
- Threat models and security architectures
- Audit-ready documentation and evidence
- Public track record of security excellence
```

**For CEOs:**
```markdown
Primary: "Build customer trust through demonstrable security"
Supporting:
- Compliance that opens market opportunities
- Risk reduction with measurable ROI
- Competitive advantage through transparency

```

### Vocabulary & Terminology

**Preferred Terms:**
```markdown
✅ Use This          ❌ Not This
- Client            - Customer (for B2B)
- Security expert   - Security guru/ninja
- Framework         - Methodology (too rigid)
- Practical         - Turnkey (oversimplification)
- Transparent       - Open (too vague)
- Implement         - Deploy (for policies/processes)
- Challenge         - Problem (more constructive)
- Opportunity       - Gap (more positive)
```

**Technical Accuracy:**
- MUST use correct technical terms
- MUST specify versions (ISO 27001:2022, not just ISO 27001)
- MUST distinguish between standards (ISO 27001 certification vs. NIST CSF adoption)
- MUST cite sources for data and claims

### Brand Language Patterns

**Opening Hooks:**
```markdown
Educational:
"Did you know [surprising fact]?"
"Most organizations struggle with [pain point]..."
"Here's a practical approach to [challenge]..."

Thought Leadership:
"The security industry often [common misconception]..."
"After 30 years in cybersecurity, we've learned..."
"Transparency in security isn't just ethical—it's strategic..."
```

**Calls-to-Action:**
```markdown
Strong CTAs:
- "Get your free security assessment"
- "Download our ISO 27001 implementation guide"
- "Schedule a consultation with our team"
- "Explore our public ISMS documentation"

Soft CTAs:
- "Learn more about [topic]"
- "See how we've helped companies like yours"

```

## Examples

### Before/After Rewriting

**Before (Too Much FUD):**
```
"Your network is probably compromised right now. Hackers are getting 
more sophisticated every day, and without enterprise-grade security, 
you're an easy target. Don't let your company be the next headline."
```

**After (Hack23 Voice):**
```
"Most organizations have security gaps they're not aware of. We help 
you identify and fix them before they become problems, using proven 
frameworks and practical controls that integrate with your existing 
processes."
```

---

**Before (Too Technical):**
```
"Our ISMS leverages a defense-in-depth paradigm with layered 
technical controls, organizational procedures, and compensating 
mechanisms per ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A."
```

**After (Accessible Expert):**
```
"Our ISMS uses multiple security layers—technical controls, clear 
procedures, and backup measures—following ISO 27001:2022 standards. 
Think of it like a castle: walls, guards, and contingency plans."
```
