# GitHub Copilot Agent Skills

This directory contains **58 specialized agent skills** organized across **12 categories** that teach GitHub Copilot repeatable, best-practice workflows for Hack23 AB projects. Skills are automatically loaded by Copilot when relevant to your task.

**Latest Update (2026-04-17)**: All 8 repo agents now carry explicit ISMS Policy Integration + Skills Integration sections with direct URLs to Information Security, Secure Development, Open Source, Access Control, Cryptographic Controls, Data Classification, AI, Change Management, and Acceptable Use policies.

## 📚 What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are collections of instructions, rules, and examples that guide Copilot's behavior for specific tasks. They enable:

- **Consistency**: Ensure all code changes follow Hack23 standards
- **Security**: Enforce security-by-design principles from ISMS policies
- **Quality**: Maintain high code quality and documentation standards
- **Automation**: Repeatable workflows that save time and reduce errors
- **Business Strategy**: Guide market positioning and revenue optimization
- **Intelligence Operations**: Enable ethical OSINT and strategic communication
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Cover unit, integration, E2E, security, accessibility
- **Agent Orchestration**: Support custom agent collaboration and patterns

## 📖 How Skills Work

### Automatic Loading

GitHub Copilot automatically:
1. Scans `.github/skills/` when you open the repository
2. Loads relevant skills based on your task context
3. Applies skill instructions to guide code generation
4. Ensures compliance with defined rules and patterns

### Skill Structure

Each skill is a subdirectory containing:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Main skill definition with YAML frontmatter
├── examples/         # Code examples and templates (optional)
├── templates/        # File templates (optional)
└── docs/            # Additional documentation (optional)
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When and why Copilot should use this skill
license: Apache-2.0
---

# Skill Name

## Purpose
Clear explanation of what this skill teaches Copilot to do.

## Rules
- Explicit, concrete rules
- What MUST be done
- What MUST NOT be done

## 🎓 Using Skills

### For Developers

Skills work automatically - just work on your code and Copilot will apply relevant skills based on context. No special commands needed.

### For Custom Agents

Agents can reference specific skills in their instructions:

```markdown
## Skill Integration

When working on this task, leverage these skills:
- `.github/skills/security/secure-development/` - Follow secure coding practices
- `.github/skills/architecture/c4-modeling/` - Use C4 model documentation patterns
- `.github/skills/quality/accessibility-wcag/` - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
```

### Testing Skills

Test skills by working on relevant tasks:

1. Make a code change related to the skill domain
2. Ask Copilot to review or suggest improvements
3. Verify that Copilot applies the skill's rules and patterns

## 🔄 Skill Lifecycle

### Creating New Skills

1. Identify a repeatable workflow or pattern
2. Create skill directory: `.github/skills/category/skill-name/`
3. Write SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
4. Add examples and templates as needed
5. Reference relevant ISMS policies
6. Test with Copilot
7. Update INDEX.md

### Updating Skills

1. Modify SKILL.md content
2. Update examples if needed
3. Test changes with Copilot
4. Update skill version in frontmatter if using versioning

### Best Practices

- **Be Explicit**: Use concrete rules, not vague suggestions
- **Provide Examples**: Show correct patterns with code
- **Set Boundaries**: Clearly state what NOT to do
- **Reference Standards**: Link to ISMS policies and external standards
- **Keep Focused**: One skill = one concern
- **Stay Current**: Update skills as standards evolve
