## Entity Descriptions

### POLITICIAN

Stores information about Swedish politicians.

| Attribute | Type | Classification | Description |
|-----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | INTERNAL | Primary key |
| personId | String | PUBLIC | Unique ID from Riksdagen API |
| firstName | String | PUBLIC | First name |
| lastName | String | PUBLIC | Last name |
| birthDate | Date | PUBLIC | Date of birth |
| gender | String | PUBLIC | Gender (M/F) |
| createdAt | Timestamp | INTERNAL | Record creation time |
| updatedAt | Timestamp | INTERNAL | Last update time |

**Indexes:**
- `idx_politician_person_id` (UNIQUE) on `personId`
- `idx_politician_name` on `lastName, firstName`

**Data Retention:** Indefinite (historical political data)

### VOTE

Records individual votes cast by politicians.

| Attribute | Type | Classification | Description |
|-----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| id | UUID | INTERNAL | Primary key |
| ballotId | UUID | INTERNAL | Foreign key to BALLOT |
| politicianId | UUID | INTERNAL | Foreign key to POLITICIAN |
| voteOption | String | PUBLIC | Yes/No/Abstain/Absent |
| voteTime | Timestamp | PUBLIC | When vote was cast |

**Indexes:**
- `idx_vote_ballot` on `ballotId`
- `idx_vote_politician` on `politicianId`
- `idx_vote_time` on `voteTime`

**Data Retention:** Indefinite (historical voting records)

## Relationships

- **POLITICIAN to PARTY**: Many-to-One (politician belongs to one party at a time)
- **POLITICIAN to VOTE**: One-to-Many (politician casts many votes)
- **BALLOT to VOTE**: One-to-Many (ballot contains many votes)
- **POLITICIAN to POLITICIAN_ROLE**: One-to-Many (politician has multiple roles over time)

## Data Classification Summary

- **PUBLIC**: Politician names, votes, documents (public record)
- **INTERNAL**: System IDs, timestamps, technical metadata
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: None
- **RESTRICTED**: None

## Performance Considerations

- Votes table will grow large (millions of records), requires partitioning by year
- Full-text search on DOCUMENT requires Elasticsearch integration
- POLITICIAN queries often join with PARTY, consider denormalization for read performance

## Migration Strategy

See `FUTURE_DATA_MODEL.md` for planned schema changes.

```

## Decision Points

### Validation Checks
- HTML validation
- CSS validation
- JavaScript linting
- Accessibility checks (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Link validation
- Security header validation

### Security Scan Thresholds
- **Block deployment**: Critical vulnerabilities
- **Warning**: High vulnerabilities (review required)
- **Pass**: Medium or lower vulnerabilities

### Lighthouse Budget
- Performance: ≥ 90
- Accessibility: ≥ 95
- Best Practices: ≥ 95
- SEO: ≥ 95

## Error Handling

All workflows include error handling:
1. **Detect error** - Automated checks or manual report
2. **Log error** - CloudWatch, GitHub Actions logs
3. **Notify** - Slack/email notification
4. **Rollback** (if deployed) - Revert to previous version
5. **Fix** - Implement correction
6. **Verify** - Test fix before re-deploying

## Performance Considerations

- **Parallel processing**: Run security scan and Lighthouse audit in parallel
- **Caching**: Cache CloudFront invalidation to avoid rate limits
- **Incremental builds**: Only process changed files
```
