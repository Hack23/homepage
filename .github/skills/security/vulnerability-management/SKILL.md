# Vulnerability Management Skill

## Purpose

Provide systematic procedures for proactive vulnerability discovery, intelligent remediation, and transparent security communication across all Hack23 projects, with measurable SLAs aligned with business impact.

## Rules

### Severity Classification and SLAs

| Severity | CVSS Score | SLA | Escalation |
|----------|-----------|-----|------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | 7 days | CEO immediate |
| **High** | 7.0-8.9 | 30 days | CEO within 1 day |
| **Medium** | 4.0-6.9 | 90 days | Weekly review |
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | 180 days | Monthly review |

### Detection Sources

**MUST** enable on all repositories:
- GitHub Dependabot for automated dependency vulnerability alerts
- GitHub CodeQL for code-level vulnerability scanning
- GitHub Secret Scanning for credential exposure
- OWASP Dependency Check (where applicable)

### Vulnerability Lifecycle

**Phase 1: Discovery**
- **MUST** enable automated scanning on all repositories
- **MUST** process vulnerability alerts within 24 hours of detection

**Phase 2: Assessment**
- **MUST** evaluate CVSS score, exploitability, attack surface, and data exposure
- **MUST** consider contextual risk (is the vulnerable component reachable?)
- **MUST** document risk assessment for each vulnerability

**Phase 3: Remediation**
- **MUST** prioritize patches and version upgrades as primary remediation
- **MUST** create security-prefixed branches for fixes: `security/CVE-YYYY-XXXXX`
- **MUST** include CVE reference and CVSS score in commit messages
- **MUST** validate fix with security scanners before merging

**Phase 4: Verification**
- **MUST** confirm vulnerability resolved by security scanner
- **MUST** ensure no new vulnerabilities introduced
- **MUST** pass all existing tests

**Phase 5: Closure**
- **MUST** document resolution in changelog
- **MUST** close associated GitHub Security Advisory
- **MUST** conduct lessons-learned for Critical/High severity

### Risk Acceptance

Risk acceptance **MUST**:
- Be approved by CEO
- Be valid for maximum 90 days
- Include documented compensating controls
- Be tracked in the risk register
- Be reviewed monthly
